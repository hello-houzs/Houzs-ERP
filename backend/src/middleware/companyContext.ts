/**
 * Company-context middleware — Phase 0b of the multi-company merge.
 * Design: docs/2026-07-多公司合并设计.md (locked).
 *
 * Resolves the ACTIVE company for the request and the set of companies the
 * caller is allowed to act in, and stashes them on the Hono context:
 *   c.get('companyId')          — active company (companies.id)
 *   c.get('companyCode')        — active company code ('HOUZS' | '2990')
 *   c.get('allowedCompanyIds')  — companies the caller may see/act in
 *   c.get('companies')          — all active companies (id/code/name)
 *
 * Resolution order for the ACTIVE company:
 *   (a) explicit switcher pick — `X-Company-Id` header (the top-bar company
 *       switcher sends it on every API call), or `?companyId=` query as a
 *       link fallback. Validated against `allowedCompanyIds`; an invalid or
 *       not-allowed pick is IGNORED (falls through to the default), never 403'd.
 *   (b) login hostname default — erp.2990shome.com -> '2990';
 *       erp.houzscentury.com / staging / localhost / anything else -> 'HOUZS'.
 *       ALSO validated against `allowedCompanyIds`: the host's company is used
 *       only when the caller is granted it, else their FIRST allowed company —
 *       never a company they don't hold. A header-less request from a restricted
 *       user must not resolve the host's company just because it asked quietly.
 * The code is then resolved to companies.id.
 *
 * INVARIANT: the active company is ALWAYS one of `allowedCompanyIds` whenever
 * both are set — via (a) or (b), header or no header. Every route that reads
 * `companyId` / `scopeToCompany` / `activeCompanyId` leans on this; the DB
 * client is service-role, so nothing downstream re-checks it.
 *
 * The pick may be a company id (preferred) OR a company code — both are matched
 * so the frontend can send whichever it holds.
 *
 * DEGRADES SAFELY, WITHOUT LEAKING: the companies master is cached
 * last-known-good, so a transient read failure keeps serving the real master
 * rather than collapsing into an unresolved fail-open. If we truly have no
 * master yet (a brand-new isolate whose first read failed), the active company
 * is resolved from the caller's OWN user_companies grants — a single grant
 * resolves even with no header; a multi-grant caller with no header is left with
 * an allow-list but NO active company, which the per-company scoping helpers now
 * treat as FAIL CLOSED (empty), never as "all companies". Only a genuinely
 * single-company / pre-migration state (no master, no grants) keeps the legacy
 * no-op, so single-company Houzs still serves unchanged.
 *
 * MOUNTING: mounted once on the whole authenticated /api/* surface (after auth +
 * idempotency, before every route — see index.ts). This covers both the SCM
 * sub-app and the native raw-SQL modules (sales / finance). Routes without any
 * company table simply never read c.get('companyId'). Pre-auth public routes
 * (/api/auth, /api/track, /api/portal, /api/supplier-portal, /api/survey,
 * /api/mail-center/inbound) are registered before this middleware and are
 * untouched. ASSR raw-SQL scoping is a separate follow-up.
