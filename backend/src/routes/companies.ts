// Companies list for the top-bar company switcher — Phase 0c of the

// resolved and stashed on the Hono context; NO DB read of its own. Any
// authenticated user may call it — the switcher is a UI affordance, not a
// gated admin surface, so no new permission verb is introduced.
//
// NO-OP property: pre-activation (companies master absent), companyContext
// leaves the context vars undefined, so this returns { companies: [] } and the
// front-end switcher stays hidden. Single-company Houzs is unchanged.

  // a company the user can't use — companyContext then ignores the disallowed
  // X-Company-Id and serves the hostname default, so the header would say one
  // company while the data is another. No data leak (backend enforces), but a
  // confusing mislabel — so we don't offer what we won't honour.

  // is granted no active company and the switcher must offer nothing rather
