// running the two together would pay a manager the showroom override AND the
// chain override on overlapping goods, which is the double-pay this model exists
// to end. routes/hr.ts dispatches on config.overrideMode; the modes are mutually
// exclusive by construction.
//
// "無限" (unlimited depth): depth is bounded by the LEVELS THE OWNER CONFIGURES,
// not by a constant in this file. Nothing here caps it.
// "讓我們自己add": one editable rate per level. Level 1 = a person's DIRECT
// reports, level 2 = their reports' reports, and so on.
// "按SO算": the goods are SO-derived (mfg_sales_orders bounded on so_date) —
// exactly the same source showroom mode reads. This file never sees a delivery
// or an invoice.
//
// THE DOUBLE-PAY GUARD, stated precisely: an earner's own sales are at distance
// 0 and NEVER appear in goodsByLevel (routes/hr.ts skips d=0), so nobody earns an
// override on a sale they already earn personal commission on. Every downline
// seller sits at exactly ONE distance from a given earner, so each SO's goods
// enter that earner's base exactly once. A manager ABOVE another manager earns at
// their own (deeper) level on the same goods — that is the pyramid the owner
// asked for, not double-pay: two DIFFERENT people, two DIFFERENT rates, each
// once. Contrast showroom mode, where two managers in one room each take the
// whole room.

// stays RM 3,000, salesperson earns the fixed RM 50, the RM 125 is dropped):
