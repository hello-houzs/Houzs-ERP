   Payment methods — the single source of truth for the L1 method vocabulary.

   Loo 2026-06-06: "i want all same together and decide from so maintenance
   page". The POS handover cards, the Backend New-SO / SO-Detail Payments
   cascade, and the SO Maintenance editor all share ONE list: the
   so_dropdown_options 'payment_method' category. This module is the bridge
   between that list and the code that branches on a method:

   - Each LOCKED maintenance row's VALUE is an immutable key ('Merchant' /
     'Online' / 'Cash') — the API blocks value edits, adds, deletes and
     deactivation for these core rows (see routes/so-dropdown-options.ts).
     2026-06-24: the L1 method set is THREE (Merchant / Online / Cash).
     'Installment' is NO LONGER a top-level method — it is the *plan under
     Merchant* (a bank EPP is Merchant + an installment_months tenure). The
     'installment' ledger code below is RETAINED for back-compat with already
     stored payment rows (mfg_sales_order_payments.method) and the manual
     Finance route, but 'Installment' is NOT a protected L1 row — so the
     migration that deactivates the L1 'Installment' so_dropdown_options row is
     not blocked / re-locked by isCorePaymentMethodRow.
   - Each VALUE maps here to an internal CODE ('merchant' / 'transfer' /
     'installment' / 'cash') — what the ledger stores
     (mfg_sales_order_payments.method) and what branch logic switches on.
   - The row's LABEL is free — renaming it in SO Maintenance re-labels the
     POS cards and the Backend selects everywhere, with zero code impact.

   Don't add a 5th code here without wiring its branch logic end-to-end
   (POS card behaviour, deposit ledger, payments route, list-grid summary).
