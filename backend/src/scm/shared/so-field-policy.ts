// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// so-field-policy — THE single source of truth for "what can be edited on a
// processing-locked Sales Order, and does Save write it or raise an amendment".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (Owner 2026-07-17)
// ---------------------------------------
// The owner's ruling: fields split into two classes.
//   * FREE      — pressing Save writes straight to the database. No gate.
//   * CONTROLLED— pressing Save raises an AMENDMENT for approval instead.
// His test for which is which: "does this change what gets DELIVERED or what
// gets CHARGED?" Contact details are not that — forcing them through an
// approval queue means people stop updating them, and then the delivery driver
// has a phone number that does not work.
//
// The split ALREADY existed before this file, but as THREE hand-maintained
// literals that only prose kept in step:
//   * backend  SO_PROCESSING_LOCK_COLS  (what the header PATCH rejects)
//   * backend  AMENDABLE_HEADER_FIELDS  (what an amendment may carry)
//   * frontend AMENDABLE_HEADER_KEYS    (what the forms route to the amendment)
// They had already drifted: `city` was disabled by the mobile UI and named in
// its lock copy, but was in NEITHER backend set — so a City change on a locked
// SO wrote straight through if posted, and could not be requested by amendment
// either. This table is now the origin of all three, and a drift test asserts
// the frontend vendored copy still matches it.
//
// CLASSES
// -------
//   FREE       Writable at any point in the SO's life. Save writes it directly.
//              Audited (entity-audit) — a freely editable field is exactly the
//              one nobody approves, so the audit trail is its only control.
//   CONTROLLED Frozen on the header PATCH once the SO is processing-locked; the
//              amendment workflow is the sanctioned channel to change it.
//   DERIVED    Frozen like CONTROLLED, but NOT directly requestable: the server
//              recomputes it from another CONTROLLED field. Callers must omit
//              it rather than send it, or the lock diff 409s on it.
//
// NOT IN THIS TABLE
// -----------------
// LINE-level fields (item, spec/variants, qty, unit price, FOC, per-line
// warehouse_id) are CONTROLLED wholesale by the per-route processing lock
// (soProcessingLockBlocked) — every line mutation 409s once locked, and the
// amendment carries item / variants / qty / unit price. Warehouse binding has
// NO direct amendment path by design: it is re-derived from an approved State
// change. See the WAREHOUSE note below.
//
// WAREHOUSE / POSTCODE — a correction to a widely-held belief
// ----------------------------------------------------------
// Postcode does NOT determine the warehouse. `deriveWarehouseIdFromState`
// (mfg-sales-orders.ts) resolves warehouse from customer_state ONLY, via
// scm.state_warehouse_mappings — a table that has no postcode column. Delivery
// region / TMS routing is likewise state-keyed (delivery_planning_regions).
// Postcode is frozen for a DIFFERENT and independently valid reason: it is
// printed on the supplier PO as the delivery destination, so it must not drift
// after the SO is PO'd. City freezes for that same reason, and only that reason.

/* WHY FREE IS THE DEFAULT, AND WHAT THAT COSTS
   -------------------------------------------
   The free bucket is "every patchable column not named above": customer name,
   phone, email, customer type, customer SO ref, salesperson, building type,
   venue, branding, note, address lines 1-4, emergency contact + relationship,
   and the payments collection. That matches the owner's ruling and matches how
   the header PATCH has always behaved.

   It is a RESIDUE, not a per-field decision, and two entries deserve the
   owner's eye rather than my silence:
     * ship_to_address / bill_to_address / install_to_address and address3 /
       address4 are free-text delivery destinations by name, and they render on
       supplier-facing paperwork — which is the exact rationale used to freeze
       Postcode and City. They are left FREE because the owner ruled "address
       lines save straight away" and these are address lines. Flagged, not
       silently reclassified.
     * A delivery-address change on an SO with an already-SCHEDULED delivery
       trip does not re-plan that trip. The address is free to change per the
       owner's ruling; the UI warns at the point of edit instead. */

/* ── Payments ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Owner 2026-07-17: "如果是一些好像 payment 我都可以直接 add，它可以直接给我
   create" — ADDING a payment is FREE at any point in the order's life,
   including after delivery. Money arrives over time. That is unchanged.

   Owner 2026-07-19, on EDIT and DELETE: "删除只有在当天才行。正常情况下，他当天
   key in 的时候，因为还没有 lock 下来，所以当天都可以任意更改。" — a payment row
   may be edited or deleted ONLY on the day it was keyed in. Same-day entries
   are still fluid because nothing has locked yet, so anything goes; from the
   next day, no. This supersedes the earlier "mandatory typed reason" default:
   the owner ruled the same-day window IS the control, and 任意更改 means a
   same-day correction is not interrogated.

   TWO DETAILS THAT ARE EXPLOITABLE IF READ LOOSELY:

   1. "Same day" = the day the ROW WAS CREATED (created_at), NOT the payment
      date on the document (paid_at). Keying off paid_at would let anyone
      unlock a months-old payment for deletion just by editing its date to
      today — the edit and the delete would authorise each other.

   2. The day boundary is MALAYSIA (UTC+8, no DST), closing at MYT midnight.
      Workers run in UTC; computing this in UTC would either hold the window
      open 8h into the next business day or slam it shut at 16:00 UTC (=
      midnight MYT) — depending on direction, and both are wrong. Use the
      house helpers (scm/lib/my-time.ts `mytDateOf` / `todayMyt` on the server,
      vendor/scm/lib/dates.ts `isCreatedTodayMyt` on the client). Do not
      invent a new convention here.

   WHERE THE FUTURE CONDITION GOES. The owner has explicitly DEFERRED the
   bank-reconciliation rule — "如果他已经做完 bank record 并且 knock off 掉了，
   就不行了" — until reconciliation and knock-off exist. Nothing about that is
   built here, and there are no speculative hooks for it. When he defines it,
   it becomes one more `&&` inside paymentRowMutable() below: that predicate is
   the ONLY place either client or the server asks "may this row still change",
   so a knock-off check added there lands on every surface at once. */

 *                        fixable). Drafts are not the owner's case; he was
 *                        describing a confirmed order.
 *
 * Both dates are required strings. Deliberately no `?? ''` fallback: an
