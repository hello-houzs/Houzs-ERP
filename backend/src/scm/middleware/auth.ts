// Auth bridge for the ported 2990's SCM routes.
//
// 2990's original `supabaseAuth` validated a Supabase Auth JWT and built a
// per-user RLS client. In Houzs the request is ALREADY authenticated by the
// global /api/* middleware (Houzs session auth, mounted in index.ts), so this
// just attaches the scm-scoped service-role supabase-js client the route
// handlers expect via `c.get('supabase')`. Same export name, so the ported
// route's `import { supabaseAuth } from '../middleware/auth'` is unchanged.
// The ported 2990's routes stamp `created_by` (uuid, FK -> scm.staff) and look up
// the caller's `staff.role` by `user.id` (also a scm.staff uuid). Houzs users are
// INTEGERS, so passing the raw Houzs id makes Postgres reject "1" as a uuid
// ("invalid input syntax for type uuid"). We therefore pin `user` to ONE seeded
// super_admin system staff row — a valid uuid identity that satisfies the FK +
// role lookups. Seed it with backend/scripts/scm-schema/seed-scm-staff.mjs.
//
// THE PIN IS A TYPE SHIM, NOT AN AUTHORIZATION OR IDENTITY STATEMENT. Two claims
// that used to sit here were false, and each one manufactured a bug:
//   · "every caller here is an admin (/api/scm/* is owner-gated)" — NOT TRUE.
//     src/index.ts:250 gates the tree with requireScmAccess, which also admits any
//     position granted a scm* page-access area, and scm/middleware/area-guard.ts
//     admits scoped salespeople per area. Ordinary users reach these routes.
//     So NEVER gate on `user` or staff.role — the pinned row reports super_admin
//     for everybody. Gate on the REAL caller via lib/houzs-perms (hasHouzsPerm /
//     canViewAllSales / canViewScmFinance).
//   · "per-user attribution would need a Houzs-user -> scm.staff sync — a later
//     enhancement" — THAT BRIDGE IS BUILT. Migration 0066 gives every non-disabled
//     user a deterministic staff row (md5('houzs-user:'||id)::uuid) linked by
//     staff.user_id. Resolve the caller's REAL staff uuid with
//     resolveCallerStaffId(sb, c.get('houzsUser')?.id) (lib/salesScope.ts), and
//     their row scope with resolveSalesScopeIds / salesDocOutOfScope.
// Trusting the first claim shipped the pos-cart leak (#633): the cart keyed on
// c.get('user').id, so every salesperson shared ONE row. Anything per-person —
// attribution, ownership, a cart, a visibility scope — reads `houzsUser` and the
// 0066 bridge, never the pinned `user`.
