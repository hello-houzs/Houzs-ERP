// ── L2 per-area WRITE authorization for /api/scm/* ──────────────────────────
//
// SAFE, ADDITIVE layer on top of the coarse `requireScmAccess` umbrella that
// already gates /api/scm/* in the main index.ts. Each SCM sub-router is mounted
// in scm/index.ts behind `scmAreaGuard('<L2 area key>')`, which enforces the L2
// page-access matrix per HTTP method:
//
//   GET / HEAD            → require 'view'   (read)
//   POST / PATCH / PUT /  → require 'edit'   (write/void/delete)
//   DELETE
//
// NO-LOCKOUT ROLLOUT — the MATRIX half of the gate is enforced ONLY for users
// who already have an explicit SCM L2 configuration. Resolution order:
//   1. Owner / wildcard (`*`)        → next()  (bypass; never gated)
//   1.5 Sales JD deny (salesJdAccess.salesJdDenial) → 403  (ENFORCED ALWAYS)
//                                         A rule in code, not a matrix cell, so
//                                         it does NOT wait for the L2 rollout —
//                                         that is the difference between a rule
//                                         and a setting. Today: exactly
//                                         scm.sales.returns, for the Sales
//                                         cohort (owner 2026-07-17 "就是要关").
//   1.6 Money-write deny (positionPolicy.moneyWriteDenial) → 403  (ENFORCED ALWAYS)
//                                         Owner 2026-07-18: default-full is about
//                                         SEEING, not doing. A WRITE on the finance
//                                         areas (journal entries / payment vouchers)
//                                         is Finance-only. Reads never denied, and
//                                         only the finance areas are in scope.
//   2. user.scm_l2_configured === true → require meetsLevel(level, required),
//                                         else 403  (ENFORCED)
//   3. otherwise (no SCM L2 rows)    → next()  (fall back to the coarse
//                                         scm.access umbrella already enforced
//                                         upstream — so no current scm.access
//                                         holder is locked out before the
//                                         matrix is seeded)
//
// IMPORTANT — middleware ordering: this runs from `scm.use('/<prefix>/*', ...)`
// in scm/index.ts, which executes BEFORE the mounted sub-router's own
// `router.use('*', supabaseAuth)`. supabaseAuth REPLACES c.get('user') with a
// Supabase system-staff shape; this guard reads the Houzs AuthUser while it is
// still intact. Hence the cast from the scm Variables.user (typed Supabase User)
// to AuthUser here.

/**
 * Options — least-privilege escape hatches for routes whose L2 "home" area is
 * an ADMIN area but whose consumers are ordinary staff (added 2026-07-04 to
 * unblock the mobile SO + scan flow for Members, e.g. Sales Executive with
 * scm.sales.* = view and everything else = none):
 *
 * - `openRead` — GET/HEAD skip the per-area check entirely (writes still
 *   enforce `edit` on the area). For SO-flow REFERENCE reads that happen to
 *   live under scm.procurement.products (so-dropdown-options, fabric-library,
 *   mfg-products, maintenance-config, product-models, special-addons): a
 *   salesperson filling an SO must read these picklists, but must NOT need
 *   view access to the whole Products admin area. Same spirit as the
 *   SHARED READ HELPERS left on the coarse umbrella in scm/index.ts, except
 *   these routers also have admin writes, so the guard stays for writes.
 *
 * - `writeLevel` — override the level required for POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE
 *   (default 'edit'). Used as `'view'` for scan-so / scan-payment / slips:
 *   their POSTs (warm, enqueue, extract, slip-upload init/confirm) only stage
 *   uploads and background OCR that produce the CALLER's own draft (the
 *   pipeline stamps the caller's staff uuid — PR #245); they never mutate an
 *   existing SO. Actual SO create/edit (mfg-sales-orders) keeps 'edit'.
 *
 * - `openReadPaths` — the SAME escape hatch as `openRead`, but scoped to named
 *   sub-paths instead of the whole router. Needed where a router mixes one
 *   harmless REFERENCE read with genuinely sensitive ones: `/inventory/*` serves
 *   stock levels, FIFO lots, COGS and valuation, so `openRead` on it would be a
 *   real leak — but `GET /inventory/warehouses` is a bare picklist (id / code /
 *   name / location / is_active / is_default, no cost, no quantities) that the SO
 *   and PO forms' Ship-to + Purchase Location dropdowns, and the SO Maintenance
 *   state→warehouse mapping, cannot render without. Listing that ONE path keeps
 *   the rest of the Inventory API gated exactly as before.
 *
 *   Matched as a suffix of `c.req.path`, because the guard runs under the
 *   `/api/scm` mount and does not know its own prefix. Entries are absolute
 *   under that mount (e.g. `/inventory/warehouses`); GET/HEAD only, writes are
 *   never opened.
 *
 * - `readInheritsFrom` — a SECOND area key whose `view` grant ALSO satisfies a
 *   GET/HEAD on this area (writes still require `edit` on the NATIVE area).
 *   Used so a salesperson (scm.sales.orders = view) can READ Delivery Orders +
 *   Sales Invoices generated from their OWN Sales Orders even without a
 *   scm.sales.delivery / scm.sales.invoices grant — the DO/SI routes already
 *   row-scope every read to own+downline (lib/salesScope) and strip cost/margin
 *   from non-finance callers (canViewScmFinance), so this opens NO office/finance
 *   data. Reads only; a salesperson still cannot create/edit a DO/SI.
