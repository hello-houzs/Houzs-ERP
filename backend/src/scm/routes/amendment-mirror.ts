// /amendment-mirror — LIVE receiver for the 2990 -> Houzs one-way SO AMENDMENT
// mirror. The owner's ask: an amendment raised in 2990 must show up in Houzs.
//
// The 2990 database (via pg_cron + pg_net) POSTs each changed amendment here as
// { amendmentId, header, lines } (raw 2990-shaped rows) or { amendmentId,
// deleted:true }. Same shape, same auth, same transform rules as so-mirror.ts —
// see docs/2990-live-sync/04_amendment_outbox_2990.sql for the sender.
//
// ONE-WAY, READ-ONLY. Nothing here writes back to 2990 and Houzs cannot drive a
// mirrored amendment: all five mutation gates in routes/so-amendments.ts load
// through loadAmendmentForWrite, which refuses when isMirroredDocNo(so_doc_no).
// Because we stamp `2990-` on so_doc_no below, every row this route writes is
// read-only in Houzs BY CONSTRUCTION. The command channel (approving from Houzs)
// is a separate build and deliberately does not exist yet.
//
// AUTH: the same static shared secret as so-mirror (x-sync-secret ==
// env.SYNC_SECRET) — the caller is the same 2990 database, not a user with a
// Supabase JWT. Fail-closed when the secret is unset.
//
// Mounted at '/api/sync/amendment-mirror' in src/index.ts — PRE-AUTH, above the
// /api/* staff-session gate, because the caller is a database with no session.

   status is a Postgres ENUM. There is no safe "nearest" value: guessing would
   report a fabricated approval state on a document that gates a financial
   rewrite. So we REFUSE an unknown status instead of coercing it. The refusal is
   non-2xx, so 2990's confirm_amendment_outbox() puts the row back to 'pending'
   and retries forever, and the drift surfaces as a stall the sentinel alarms on
