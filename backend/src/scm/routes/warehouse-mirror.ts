// /warehouse-mirror — LIVE receiver for the 2990 -> Houzs one-way WAREHOUSE
// mirror.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: the same design risk R3 that wedged SO-2607-013 for 27 hours
// on a missing customer, one FK column over. scm.mfg_sales_order_items.
// warehouse_id carries a live FK to scm.warehouses (mfg_sales_order_items_
// warehouse_id_warehouses_id_fk), and warehouses were a ONE-TIME frozen import
// (migrate-2990-into-houzs.mjs, 33 tables, ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING, never
// updates). So the first SO line bound to a warehouse 2990 opened after that
// import fails the FK forever, exactly as the customer did. D6: masters mirror
// first, or everything else 500s.
//
// Unlike customers, this one is NOT known to be firing today — see the PR notes.
// It ships as the structural fix for a live FK parent that cannot self-heal, not
// as an incident response.
//
// The 2990 database (via pg_cron + pg_net) POSTs each changed warehouse here as
// { warehouseId, warehouse } (a raw 2990-shaped row) or { warehouseId,
// deleted:true }. Same shape, same auth, same transform rules as the other four
// receivers — see docs/2990-live-sync/06_masters_outbox_2990.sql for the sender.
//
// ONE-WAY, READ-ONLY, and `company_id = 2` IS the correct write-guard here — the
// same argument customer-mirror.ts makes, and it transfers cleanly because the
// same two facts hold: warehouses is a PER-COMPANY table (it has company_id,
// added by mig 0086 precisely so 2990's warehouses could migrate), and company_id
// does not over-match (nothing in Houzs mints a Houzs-NATIVE company-2 warehouse
// the way the headless scan job mints a company-2 SO — see lib/companyScope.ts's
// MIRRORED-SYSTEM OWNERSHIP note for that distinction). Every statement below is
// scoped to it.
//
// The global-unique trap that customers hit (customers_name_phone_unique, an
// unscoped index across two independent books, fixed by mig 0123) WAS present
// here too and is ALREADY FIXED: mig 0087 dropped warehouses_code_unique and
// replaced it with warehouses_company_code_unique UNIQUE (company_id, code). So
// 2990 and Houzs can each hold a warehouse coded 'KL'. No migration is needed for
// this receiver — 0086 + 0087 already prepared the table. Verified by reading
// both files, not assumed.
//
// WHETHER 2990'S WAREHOUSE SET ACTUALLY CHURNS IS NOT KNOWN — see the PR notes.
// The repo can prove the WEDGE (a live FK + a frozen import + FK checks that are
// ON for this receiver but were OFF for the import) but it cannot prove the
// FREQUENCY: nothing in the tree says how often 2990 opens a warehouse. A
// warehouse is opened once a year, not once a day, so the honest reading is that
// this ships as cheap structural insurance on a parent that CANNOT self-heal, not
// as a bug that is firing. If it never fires, it costs one drain tick.
//
// AUTH: the same static shared secret as the other receivers (x-sync-secret ==
// env.SYNC_SECRET) — the caller is the same 2990 database, not a user with a
// Supabase JWT. Fail-closed when the secret is unset (see mirrorAuthed).
//
// Mounted at '/api/sync/warehouse-mirror' in src/index.ts — PRE-AUTH, above the
// /api/* staff-session gate, because the caller is a database with no session.

/* No prefixCols: a warehouse carries no doc number, and `code` is left verbatim
   so mirrored and batch-imported rows stay interchangeable (0087 makes the code
   company-scoped, so it does not need to be made unique by prefixing).

   scm.warehouses has NO outbound FK of its own (verified against the schema
   dump: zero `ALTER TABLE "warehouses" ADD CONSTRAINT … FOREIGN KEY`), so unlike
   staff there is no dangling-master column to force NULL.

   is_default IS forced false, and it is the one non-obvious rule here.
   is_default is not descriptive data — it is a HOUZS OPERATIONAL FLAG read by
   defaultWarehouseId() (lib/inventory-movements.ts), which is COMPANY-BLIND:
   `.eq('is_default', true).order('code').limit(1)`. It is the fallback warehouse
   for GRN / DO / return / consignment posts that carry no warehouse of their own.
   Mirroring 2990's is_default=true verbatim therefore enters 2990's warehouse
   into the draw for HOUZS's inventory fallback, and `.order('code')` decides —
   silently, on alphabetical order, with no error. 2990's "default" is a statement
   about 2990's till, and it means nothing in Houzs's inventory. Forcing false is
   what makes a mirrored row unable to say it.

   NOTE: the batch importer did NOT force this (NULL_COLS has no warehouses
   entry), so any already-imported 2990 warehouse may be carrying is_default=true
   in prod right now. The 06 backfill re-delivers every 2990 warehouse through
   this receiver, so switching this mirror on also CLEARS that latent flag. See
   the PR notes — worth checking on staging before enabling.

   is_active is NOT forced: a mirrored SO line's warehouse_id must resolve to a
   readable warehouse, and the warehouse list is already company-scoped
   (scopeToCompany in routes/inventory.ts), so an active 2990 warehouse cannot
   leak into a Houzs picker. Contrast staff, which has no company_id and so has
   to be held out of pickers by `active` instead. Leaving is_active un-forced is
   also what lets the delete path below MEAN something: it is the one column a
   2990 delete writes. */

    // ---- DELETE DEACTIVATES. IT DOES NOT DELETE. -----------------------------
    // The obvious move is to copy customer-mirror and DELETE, on the argument
    // that mfg_sales_order_items.warehouse_id is ON DELETE SET NULL so Houzs
    // would just mirror 2990's own outcome. That argument is WRONG HERE, and the
    // reason is the one thing this mirror does not share with 2990: STATE.
    //
    // scm.warehouses has 13 inbound FKs and five of them are ON DELETE RESTRICT —
    // inventory_lots, inventory_movements, inventory_lot_consumptions,
    // stock_takes, stock_transfers (x2). All three inventory tables ARE in the
    // batch importer's 33-table ORDER, so Houzs holds a FROZEN 2026-snapshot of
    // 2990's inventory still pointing at 2990's warehouses. 2990 can therefore
    // delete a warehouse perfectly legally — it cleared ITS lots first — while
    // Houzs's copy of those same lots is stale and still references the row. The
    // DELETE then RAISES on a restrict FK, the receiver 500s, and the outbox
    // retries forever. That is not a hypothetical: it is SO-2607-013's exact
    // failure shape, re-created by the very file meant to prevent it.
    //
    // So a hard delete has two outcomes and both are bad: it either fails
    // PERMANENTLY on a restrict FK (that row retrying every 10s forever, with no
    // resolution short of an operator), or, if no lot happens to reference the
    // row, it succeeds and silently NULLs warehouse_id on real mirrored SO lines.
    // Deactivating has neither failure: it never raises, it
    // keeps the row alive as the FK target the frozen inventory and the mirrored
    // SO lines both still need, and is_active=false is what actually removes it
    // from Houzs's company-2 warehouse pickers — which is the whole of what
    // "2990 deleted this warehouse" should mean to Houzs.
    //
    // Scoped to company 2 so a bad id can never reach a Houzs-native warehouse.
    // If 2990 later re-creates the id, the normal upsert path carries its real
    // is_active back and the row returns to service.

    //   * warehouses_code_unique — the PRE-0087 global index is still in place, so
    //     a 2990 warehouse sharing a code with a Houzs-native one is rejected even
    //     though the two are independent. That would wedge this mirror exactly as
    //     the FK wedged the SO. If this appears, 0087 has not applied — fix that,
    //     not this file. (The post-0087 name is warehouses_company_code_unique;
    //     seeing THAT one means two 2990 warehouses share a code, which is a 2990
    //     data problem.)
