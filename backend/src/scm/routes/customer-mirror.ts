// /customer-mirror — LIVE receiver for the 2990 -> Houzs one-way CUSTOMER mirror.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: this is design risk R3 firing in production. The one-time
// master import (scripts/migrate-2990-into-houzs.mjs) is a FROZEN snapshot that
// never updates, but SOs mirror LIVE. scm.mfg_sales_orders.customer_id carries a
// live FK to scm.customers (proven, not assumed: SO-2607-013 resolved every other
// FK it holds and still 500s on customer_id alone). So a 2990 customer that does
// not exist in Houzs makes that customer's first SO fail the FK forever — the
// receiver 500s, 2990's outbox retries every 10s, and the SO never lands.
// SO-2607-013 sat wedged for 27+ hours across 6582 attempts on exactly this.
// D6 says masters must mirror before their children. They never did.
//
// The 2990 database (via pg_cron + pg_net) POSTs each changed customer here as
// { customerId, customer } (a raw 2990-shaped row) or { customerId, deleted:true }.
// Same shape, same auth, same transform rules as so-mirror.ts / amendment-mirror.ts
// — see docs/2990-live-sync/05_customer_outbox_2990.sql for the sender.
//
// ONE-WAY, READ-ONLY. Unlike the SO and amendment mirrors, the read-only-ness is
// NOT enforced by a doc-no prefix, because a customer has no doc number. See
// lib/companyScope.ts's MIRRORED-SYSTEM OWNERSHIP note for why the prefix (not
// company_id) guards SO writes: company_id over-matches there, because the
// headless scan job legitimately mints a Houzs-NATIVE SO stamped company_id=2.
//
// For customers company_id does NOT over-match, and that is the whole argument:
// per the design's §2a row 2 the verdict is MIRROR-RO — 2990 is a retailer with
// its own customer book, so EVERY company-2 customer is 2990's by definition and
// a Houzs-native company-2 customer is not a thing that should exist. So
// `company_id = 2` is the correct write-guard here, and every statement below is
// scoped to it.
//
// customer_code is NOT a usable provenance marker and must not become one:
// upsert_customer_by_name_phone (backend/scripts/scm-schema/port-missing-functions-
// triggers.sql) mints `2990S-XXXXXXXX` codes in HOUZS too — it is a port of 2990's
// own minter, prefix and all. Both systems emit the same prefix, so the prefix
// distinguishes nothing. The import does not prefix customer_code either, so
// mirrored and batch-imported rows stay interchangeable by leaving it verbatim.
//
// AUTH: the same static shared secret as the SO/amendment mirrors (x-sync-secret
// == env.SYNC_SECRET) — the caller is the same 2990 database, not a user with a
// Supabase JWT. Fail-closed when the secret is unset.
//
// Mounted at '/api/sync/customer-mirror' in src/index.ts — PRE-AUTH, above the
// /api/* staff-session gate, because the caller is a database with no session.

   companies, and unlike so_amendments there is no Houzs-only column a 2990 row

   filtering + array coercion from lib/mirror-map.ts is the entire transform.
