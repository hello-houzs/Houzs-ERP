// /unbilled-deliveries — goods that LEFT THE WAREHOUSE and were never charged
// for, aged. Read-only: this route never writes.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN /outstanding/do ALREADY SAYS "DOs not yet invoiced".
// It doesn't say that — it says "nobody clicked INVOICED on this DO". The view
// (scm.v_do_outstanding, mig 0084) is a HEADER-STATUS FLAG:
//     is_outstanding := status NOT IN ('INVOICED','CANCELLED')
// with no money column at all — which is why outstanding.ts's SUMMARY_AGG maps
// `do: { amtCol: null }` and the DO tab can only ever report a COUNT. It cannot
// show what the gap is worth, and three things make its flag the wrong question:
//
//   1. NOTHING IN THE CODEBASE EVER WRITES delivery_orders.status='INVOICED'.
//      Creating a Sales Invoice from a DO does not advance the DO: sales-invoices.ts
//      only READS the DO header (`.select('id, status')`), it never updates it. The
//      only writers of DO status are the operator-driven PATCH /:id/status and the
//      Delivery-Planning board. So the flag measures whether someone REMEMBERED to
//      click a status — not whether we billed. It is unreliable in BOTH directions:
//      a fully-billed DO left at DELIVERED looks like leakage (false positive), and
//      a DO clicked to INVOICED with one line billed out of five looks clean (false
//      negative — the expensive direction).
//   2. IT IS HEADER-LEVEL, so a PARTLY invoiced DO is all-or-nothing. Partial
//      invoicing is exactly where money hides.
//   3. IT DOES NOT AGE. Steady-state un-invoiced runs 1–3%/month; the CURRENT month
//      runs ~67% and that is normal billing lag, not leakage. An un-aged list is
//      dominated by rows nobody should act on, so nobody reads it twice.
//
// This report answers the money question instead, from the LINE ledger.
//
// ── "DELIVERED" = THE STOCK ACTUALLY LEFT ────────────────────────────────────
// Not a new opinion — the SAME predicate that already moved the stock.
// delivery-orders-mfg.ts declares SHIPPED_STATES ("goods have left our hands, so
// stock has been deducted"; the first transition into any of them fires the
// inventory OUT), DO_STOCK_OUT_STATUSES ("statuses in which the inventory OUT has
// already been written") and their complement DO_PRESHIP_STATUSES = {DRAFT,
// LOADED} ("no stock has left our hands yet"). If the inventory OUT was written,
// the goods are gone and someone owes us for them — so THAT is the definition
// this report uses, and it and the stock ledger cannot disagree about what "left"
// means. A LOADED DO is still on the lorry: billing it would be the bug, not the
// finding. CANCELLED delivered nothing. See NOT_SHIPPED_STATES below for why the
// predicate is written as the complement rather than as a positive list.
//
// NOTE the deliberate asymmetry: the status 'INVOICED' COUNTS AS SHIPPED here.
// This report reads the header status ONLY as evidence the goods SHIPPED, and
// NEVER as evidence they were BILLED. Billing is answered from the line links
// below — which is the whole point of (1).

/* NOT-SHIPPED states — the states we EXCLUDE, expressed as the complement.
   This is deliberately a NEGATIVE filter, and the reason matters:
     • It is exactly DO_PRESHIP_STATUSES {DRAFT, LOADED} ("no stock has left our
       hands yet" — delivery-orders-mfg.ts) plus CANCELLED (delivered nothing).
       Every other state means the inventory OUT was written, i.e. the goods went.
     • status is the PG enum scm.do_status, and a positive `.in()` list naming a
       value the enum does NOT have makes Postgres throw ("invalid input value for
       enum do_status") — a 500, not an empty result. The tree's enum is
       {DRAFT, LOADED, DISPATCHED, IN_TRANSIT, SIGNED, DELIVERED, INVOICED,
       CANCELLED} (base schema + mig 0040 adds DRAFT), but delivery-orders-mfg.ts
       ALSO carries 'COMPLETED' in DO_STATUSES / DO_STOCK_OUT_STATUSES, and the
       scm schema is maintained OUTSIDE this migration tree (see BUG-HISTORY:
       "audit vs PROD information_schema") — so the tree cannot settle whether
       prod's enum has COMPLETED. Naming only the three values that certainly
       exist makes this query correct EITHER WAY: it can never throw, and a
       post-ship state we don't know about is INCLUDED rather than dropped.
     • The fail direction is deliberate. An unknown status surfaces a row he can
       dismiss; a positive list would have hidden that row's money silently —
       which is the exact failure this whole report exists to catch. */

  /* THE LINE LEDGER. doLineRemaining is the single source of truth already used
     by the DO→SI and DO→DR pickers and by the SI write-path guards:
         remaining = delivered − invoiced − returned
     per DO line, derived LIVE from the rows (no stored counter to drift), where
     `invoiced` counts sales_invoice_items linked by do_item_id to a NON-cancelled
     invoice and `returned` counts delivery_return_items likewise. Using it here
     means "un-invoiced" in this report is the SAME number the SI picker will
     offer him when he acts on a row — the report cannot promise money the picker
     then refuses to bill.
     It also gives three exclusions for free, as VALUE rather than as guesswork —
     see the unbilled_centi > 0 filter below.

     COST — read this before widening the default. doLineRemaining is built for a
     PICKER (a handful of DOs): it chunks every id list at 200 and issues a
     request per chunk, so it costs roughly one subrequest per 200 DOs plus one
     per 200 DO LINES, twice over (SI links + DR links). Feeding it every shipped
     DO is therefore linear in the whole book, and Workers cap a request at 1000
     subrequests. That is comfortable at today's row counts and is the reason
     minAgeDays is pushed into SQL above — a targeted read stays small. If this
     ever starts timing out, the fix is to make the ledger read set-based (one
     paged sweep per table, joined in memory), NOT to re-implement the
     remaining = delivered − invoiced − returned formula here: a second copy of
     that formula is how the report and the SI picker would start disagreeing

           clicked to INVOICED stays out: we bill from the links, not the click.)
