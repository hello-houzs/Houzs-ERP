// /sales-invoices — we bill the customer (B2B sales side).
//
// Ported from 2990's apps/api/src/routes/sales-invoices.ts. A faithful clone of
// the Delivery Order API (delivery-orders-mfg.ts), itself a Sales Order clone:
// editable SO-style header, line-item CRUD, a payments ledger, a recomputeTotals
// rollup, plus a convert-from-DO that copies a Delivery Order's header + all line
// items (with variants + prices) into a new invoice.
//
// REVENUE: a Sales Invoice records revenue the moment it is created/confirmed.
// The POST handler calls the shared idempotent poster (post-si-revenue) which
// writes Dr 1100 (AR) / Cr 4000 (Sales Revenue) = total_centi into
// journal_entries + journal_entry_lines, keyed on (source_type='SI',
// source_doc_no=invoice_number) so it can never double-post. Posting failures
// never roll back the invoice (audit-DLQ pattern).
//
// ISSUED = FROZEN: this is the ONE document that leaves the building, so once it
// is issued (any status but DRAFT — see isIssuedSi) its money and identity stop
// being writable: line items are frozen wholesale, and the header freezes
// invoice_date / currency / debtor_name / debtor_code (SI_ISSUED_FROZEN_FIELDS)
// while every neutral field stays editable. The correction path is cancel → fix
// → reopen, which already re-derives revenue, credit and paid status. Without
// this gate a PAID invoice could be re-priced under a customer holding the PDF,
// and moving an issued invoice's date stranded its JE in the original period
// (post-si-revenue fixes entry_date from invoice_date; resyncSiRevenue compares
// only the total). The resync's void+repost is the owner's 2026-06-01 ruling and
// is CORRECT — the bug was the missing gate in front of it, not the mechanic.
//
// Houzs adaptation: same plumbing as the sibling SCM routes — supabaseAuth bridge
// + scm-scoped service client via c.get('supabase'). Imports repointed from
// @2990s/shared → ../shared. NOTE: GL posting needs scm.accounts seeded with at
// least codes 1100 / 4000; customer-credit + payment paths need the two tables
// in scripts/scm-schema/0103-0110-si-payments-and-credits.sql applied.
//
// Mounted at '/sales-invoices' in scm/index.ts.

/* ── Audit trail (migration 0139 / lib/entity-audit) ───────────────────────────
   The action vocabulary is the shared six. How this module maps onto it:
     POST   — the invoice leaves DRAFT and revenue is posted to AR/GL.
     CANCEL — the status flips to CANCELLED (the document event).
     REVERSE— the AR/GL contra that follows a cancel (the LEDGER event). A
              separate row from the CANCEL for the same reason payment-vouchers
              keeps them apart: a cancel whose reversal FAILED must be
              distinguishable from one whose reversal landed.
     UPDATE — header edits, payments, and every other status transition.
   No DELETE: this module never hard-deletes an invoice. */

/* CREATE was added after the header/status/payment pass. Two things about it:

   It is recorded LATE — after the line insert and its compensating delete. Both
   create paths write the header first and delete it again if the lines fail, so
   a CREATE row emitted at insert time would describe an invoice that never
   existed and whose number was never used. recordSiCreate re-reads the persisted
   row rather than echoing the request body, which makes that ordering
   self-enforcing: a rolled-back header reads back as nothing and no row is
   written at all.

   It is recorded ONCE, before the branch that returns early for a DRAFT. The
   revenue post and the customer-credit auto-apply that follow are best-effort
   and never delete the header, so every remaining exit is a success — a second
   call on the non-draft path would be a duplicate, not extra coverage. */

/* ── Invoice price vs the AGREED ORDER price — WARN, never block ───────────
   Nothing downstream of the SO compares the two. The happy path is already
   anchored (a from-DO SI line copies its price from the DO line at /from-dos,
   which copied it from the SO at delivery-orders-mfg.ts:2867), so this is
   structurally silent there. It fires on the case that has nothing catching it
   today: a clerk hand-editing a price on the create form for goods whose price
   was agreed months ago upstream.

   WARN, NEVER REJECT. The owner ruled (Commander 2026-05-29,
   mfg-pricing-recompute.ts:337-344) that the selling price is operator-authored
   and NOT computed — a hard block would overrule him on his own document. Note
   what the anchor is: the SO's 0.5% honest-pricing gate compares a client price
   against a COMPUTED price, and per that same ruling there IS no computed
   selling figure to compare to here. So the anchor is the price the customer
   already agreed to. Same 0.5% threshold as the SO gate, so the number means
   one thing system-wide.

   Only a DO-LINKED line has an anchor. A genuinely-new manual line is silently
   fine — the owner's ruling is that an SI MAY carry direct/standalone lines, and
   an unlinked line has no agreed price to drift from. Discount is deliberately
   NOT compared: a goodwill discount granted at invoice time is legitimate and
   would false-positive constantly. One query, and only when linked lines exist. */
