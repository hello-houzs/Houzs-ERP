/* ── PI-level landed freight ("平摊") — reallocatePiCharges ──────────────────
   Migration 0082 added purchase_invoice_items.allocated_charge_centi and recost.ts
   folds it into the FIFO lot cost — but until now NO write path ever filled it, so
   the column sat at 0 forever and freight billed on the SUPPLIER'S INVOICE (the
   normal shape for RMB / cross-border sourcing, where freight arrives on the PI
   rather than the GRN) raised the PI total and the AP but never reached inventory:
   COGS understated permanently. PurchaseInvoiceNew already ships the picker, sends
   allocationMethod, and its preview names this function as the authoritative
   splitter — this is that function.

   POOL = PI-NATIVE service lines only (grn_item_id IS NULL). A service line COPIED
   DOWN from the GRN by /from-grn keeps its grn_item_id, and that charge was ALREADY
   capitalised into the lot at receive time (grn_items.allocated_charge_centi, which
   recost re-adds separately) — pooling it again here would capitalise the same
   freight twice. This is what "each capitalises EXACTLY ONCE" means in recost.ts.

   Allocated across ALL goods lines, mirroring the GRN allocator. A goods line with
   no grn_item_id owns no lot, so its share simply doesn't capitalise — the goods
   aren't in inventory to carry it.

   Pure-on-empty: no native service line ⇒ pool 0 ⇒ allocation 0 everywhere ⇒ the
   column stays 0 and every existing PI recosts byte-for-byte as before.

   METHOD IS NOT PERSISTED: scm.purchase_invoices has no allocation_method column
   (0082 added one to grns only). The create paths pass the operator's choice; a
   later line edit has nothing to read it back from and re-splits by QTY. The pool
   still sums exactly either way — only the basis degrades. Persisting it needs a
   migration + a column. */
