// /payment-audit-log — Finance's PAYMENT TRAIL: one row per
// scm.mfg_sales_order_payments entry, joined to its Sales Order header for
// customer / salesperson / venue / order-total context. Read-only: this route
// never writes.
//
// Port of 2990's GET /admin/audit-log (apps/api/src/routes/audit-log.ts) — one
// of the last Finance surfaces Houzs lacked before 2990's apps/api can retire.
//
// ── THE NAME IS NOT "audit-log", DELIBERATELY ────────────────────────────────
// Two DIFFERENT things already own that word, and conflating them is the risk:
//   · /api/audit (public.audit_events) = role / permission changes.
//   · /mfg-sales-orders/:docNo/audit-log + /consignment-orders/:docNo/audit-log
//     (scm.mfg_so_audit_log) = per-document FIELD-CHANGE history.
// This is neither: it is the MONEY ledger. 2990 mounted it at /admin/audit-log;
// mirroring that path would make "audit-log" mean a THIRD thing in one tree.
// The usual "paths mirror 2990's" rule (scm/index.ts) buys nothing here — no UI
// consumes this yet (backend-only by design; a UI needs an approved mockup
// first), so nothing depended on path parity.
//
// ── GATE: canViewScmFinance, AS A HARD 403 — NOT A COLUMN STRIP ──────────────
// Everywhere else in this tree canViewScmFinance strips cost/margin keys out of
// a payload that still has a legitimate non-finance remainder (a rep must see
// their own order lines). THIS payload has no such remainder: the entire row IS
// the finance artifact — amount, method, approval code, bank slip. A payment
// trail with the money removed is an empty list, so the gate is binary.
//
// The gate CANNOT be the area mount. scmAreaGuard('scm.finance.accounting')
// FAILS OPEN by design: `if (!user.scm_l2_configured) { await next(); }`
// (middleware/area-guard.ts) — any caller without an explicit SCM L2 config
// falls through to the coarse scm.access umbrella. That is correct for page
// access (no lockout before the matrix is seeded) and useless as a boundary for
// a money ledger. So the mount says WHERE this lives; this check says WHO.
//
// Director-only rather than a new permission key, on purpose:
//   · A new key needs a permissions.ts entry, a Team > Positions matrix row and
//     an owner decision about who holds it. Shipping an ungranted key = an
//     endpoint nobody can call, and there is no UI yet to force that decision.
//   · canViewScmFinance is the EXISTING, owner-understood finance tier — already
//     the line for cost/margin on every other SCM surface. Reusing it keeps one
//     answer to "may this person see money", instead of a second one that drifts.
//   · It fails closed (no houzsUser / no director position -> not finance) and
//     reads the REAL caller. NEVER c.get('user') — inside /api/scm/* that is the
//     pinned system staff row, which reports super_admin for everybody (the
//     pos-cart leak, #633).
// Widening later (e.g. a Finance Executive key) is safe; narrowing after Finance
// depends on it is not. See the report note on this decision.
