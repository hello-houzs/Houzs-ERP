// Scan sample review — closes the OCR self-learning loop on the BACKGROUND
// scan path.
//
// The interactive path (operator reviews the extraction inside the New SO
// form, desktop or mobile) POSTs /scan-so/samples/:id/confirm on save. That
// path has NO live caller any more — both call sites are gated on a scan
// handoff nothing performs since the modal became a pure /enqueue surface
// (docs/modules/scan-to-so.md §4). The BACKGROUND path (POST /scan-so/enqueue
// -> queue -> DRAFT SO) is the only one that runs: runScanJob stamps
// scan_jobs.sample_id (scan-so.ts) and then nothing ever confirms that sample.
// The operator's review DOES happen — they open the DRAFT and either confirm
// it or edit it — but that event was wired to nothing, so the main scan route
// fed the loop NOTHING. This module is what listens to it.
//
// The confirmation event is the DRAFT -> CONFIRMED status transition
// (PATCH /mfg-sales-orders/:docNo/status).
//
// TWO outcomes are captured here, and they teach different consumers:
//
//   confirmed UNCHANGED -> ACCEPTED, `corrected = extracted`. The DRAFT is
//     built FROM the sample's `extracted` blob, so "the operator changed
//     nothing" makes `corrected = extracted` exactly true — the same object,
//     no shape to get wrong. Feeds the few-shot pool only (zero diff).
//
//   confirmed WITH EDITS -> CONFIRMED, `corrected` REBUILT from the final SO.
//     This is the diff-bearing pair every distiller mines, and until this
//     landed it was thrown away: the corrections — the single most valuable
//     signal in the module — were discarded. The blob is NOT a reversal of the
//     whole lossy slip -> SO mapper. It is `extracted` with a CURATED set of
//     faithfully-invertible fields overlaid from the operator's final SO; every
//     field whose forward mapping is lossy, derived or repriced is carried
//     across from `extracted` untouched, so it contributes NO diff and cannot
//     teach a rule the operator never wrote. See buildCorrectedSlipFromSo for
//     the field-by-field reasoning, and CARRIED_NOT_INVERTED for the exclusions.
//
// The old rule ("an edited draft is left alone, because writing
// corrected = extracted for it would assert the AI read correctly about a
// reading a human had just fixed") is NOT relaxed — it is honoured. We never
// write `corrected = extracted` for an edited draft. We either write the
// operator's real values, or, when the edit touched nothing the OCR emits,
// we still write nothing at all.

       nothing and, inside their LIMIT window, evicts a real correction. Worse,

       today's behaviour for an edited draft.

       Deliberately NOT triggering the distillers here. POST /samples/:id/confirm
       fires them in waitUntil, but that route is a scan-owned surface; this one
       is the SO status transition, and hanging three sequential Anthropic calls
       off every DRAFT->CONFIRMED would put billed API traffic on a hot order
       path (and would need an import of scan-so.ts, which imports
       mfg-sales-orders.ts, which imports this module — a cycle). The weekly
       Sunday cron rebuild (backend/src/index.ts) is the backstop for the
       distilled rule layers, and the FEW-SHOT pool reads `corrected` live at
       extract time, so the sample takes effect on the very next scan. */
