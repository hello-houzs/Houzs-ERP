// venue-binding.ts — THE venue resolver. One pure function, one SQL loader.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
// Before it, the SAME query was written out THREE times in
// routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts: the GET /active-venue endpoint (so the New-SO form
// can pre-select the venue), the create-time venue TEXT fallback, and the
// create-time project_id hard-link (#814). Three copies of a rule that decides
// which exhibition a sale is attributed to — and therefore which fair's P&L and
// whose commission it lands in. They had already begun to differ (the endpoint
// joins project_venues to return a master id; the other two do not), and a
// fourth caller (mobile) was next. Now there is one rule and three callers.
//
// Desktop and mobile share this layer by construction: both hit the same HTTP
// endpoints, which call resolveVenueBinding(). Neither client re-implements it.
//
// ── THE OWNER'S RULE (2026-07-19) ───────────────────────────────────────────
// A salesperson gets bound to a venue two ways, and both must coexist:
//   1. PMS / exhibition — picked as Sales Attending (or PIC) on a project. Their
//      orders during that project's PERIOD bind to that project's venue.
//   2. Showroom — "parked under" a Showroom on the Members page. Their orders
//      attribute to that showroom's venue.
//
// Resolution order: PMS first, showroom second, then NOTHING.
//
// Rule 3 is the important one. There is NO company default, NO first-venue
// fallback, NO `?? ''`. An unresolvable venue is EMPTY. This codebase has a
// documented history of `??` defaults turning "I don't know" into a confident
// wrong value (three money bugs in one day), and venue feeds exhibition P&L and
// commission — a guessed venue is a wrong profit figure attributed to a real
// person. Empty is honest and visibly incomplete; wrong is neither.
//
// The two bindings are deliberately NOT mutually exclusive. The owner considered
// forbidding a showroom-parked rep from being picked in PMS and chose the
// alternative: the binding is a DEFAULT, manual override always possible. A
// showroom salesperson sent to an exhibition is normal and frequent; mutual
// exclusion would make the venue wrong precisely DURING the exhibition, which is
// when it matters most.

 * Every value here is a `YYYY-MM-DD` MALAYSIAN CALENDAR DATE, never an instant:
 * `projects.start_date`/`end_date` are TEXT dates entered in the Malaysian
 * office, and the order date is either the user-typed `soDate` or `todayMyt()`
 * (lib/my-time.ts, which shifts +8h BEFORE slicing precisely so a Worker running
 * in UTC does not read yesterday's date all morning). Comparing them as plain
 * lexicographic strings is therefore an exact MYT-to-MYT comparison — there is
 * no timezone left in the values to get wrong.
 *
 * This is why the comparison must NOT be done with `Date` objects: `new
 * Date('2026-07-19')` is UTC midnight, which is 08:00 MYT, and any arithmetic
 * from there re-introduces the off-by-one at midnight that would attribute an
 * order to the wrong exhibition. The CALLER's job is to hand this function MYT
 * date strings; the tests pin that contract at the 16:00Z/00:00-MYT boundary.
 *
 * `end_date` is INCLUSIVE (the last day of the fair is a trading day) and NULL
 * means open-ended — a project that has started and has no declared end is
 * still running. A NULL start_date cannot contain anything: an undated project
 * has no period, and treating it as "always" would make it swallow every order.

 * That was arbitrary in two ways. It never checked `end_date`, so a fair that
 * ended in March still claimed every order in July — forever, for anyone who was
 * ever a Sales Attending rep on it. And among projects sharing a start_date it
 * picked whatever the planner returned, so the same rep on the same day could
 * get a different venue on two identical orders. Both are fixed here; the
 * end_date fix is the behaviour change worth calling out (an ENDED project no
 * longer resolves — which is what "during that project's period" means).
 *
 * The tie-break chain, most to least significant:
 *   1. LATEST start_date. Of two overlapping periods, the one that started more
 *      recently is the one the rep is at now; the older is the background
 *      campaign they were also assigned to.
 *   2. SHORTEST period. Same start, so specificity decides: a 3-day fair inside
 *      a 3-month regional campaign is where the rep physically is. An
 *      open-ended project (no end_date) is treated as infinitely long and so
 *      always loses this step — which also encodes "a bounded fair beats an
 *      open-ended campaign".
 *   3. LOWEST project id. Not meaningful, and not pretending to be — it is the
 *      final, stable arbiter so that two genuinely indistinguishable projects
 *      always produce the SAME answer rather than a planner-order coin flip. A
