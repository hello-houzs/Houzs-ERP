 * added to 118 tables by migration 0061 + the companyContext middleware.
 *
 * Two patterns, one company_id column:
 *
 *  • PER-COMPANY modules (SO / PO / GRN / PI / DO / SI / inventory / accounting
 *    / catalog / suppliers): the top-bar switcher ISOLATES the two companies'
 *    books. Their list + detail queries call `scopeToCompany(query, c)` to add
 *    `.eq('company_id', <active>)`, and stamp `company_id = <active>` on INSERT
 *    via `activeCompanyId(c)`.
 *
 *  • CROSS-COMPANY VIEW modules (TMS: trips / delivery-planning / fleet): ONE
 *    shared queue across both companies, each row tagged with its company. They
 *    call `scopeToAllowedCompanies(query, c)` to add `.in('company_id',
 *    <allowed>)` (WIDEN, don't isolate) and enrich rows with a company label via
 *    `companyCodeMap(c)` / `withCompanyCode(...)` so the UI can render a company
 *    column. On INSERT they still stamp the ACTIVE company (a trip is created
 *    from whichever company you're currently in; it can still reference the
 *    other company's DOs).
 *
 *  • HOUZS-ONLY module (Service Cases / ASSR): a Houzs-exclusive concept (2990
 *    has 0% service overlap). Its raw-SQL reads pin to HOUZS via
 *    `houzsCompanySql(c)` / `houzsCompanyIds(c)` — NOT the caller's allowed set —
 *    so a both-company user never sees 2990 orders/customers/cases under Service
 *    Cases. See routes/assr.ts.
 *
 * All helpers NO-OP when the active/allowed company is unresolved (companies
 * master absent pre-migration, or a DB cold-start) — so single-company Houzs
 * keeps working unchanged.
 *
 * supabase-js ONLY. Raw `env.DB` SQL paths (e.g. the native ASSR list) can't use
 * these — they must add the company predicate / column by hand. See the raw-SQL
 * checklist in the Phase 0b commit message.

   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

   The helpers above DEGRADE when the active company is unresolved: no
   predicate, so single-company Houzs kept serving through a pre-migration or
   cold-start window. That is the right trade for a READ. It is the wrong trade
   for a WRITE, where "I don't know which company" degrades to "act on ALL
   companies' rows" — which is how setting your default warehouse came to demote
   the other company's default.

   So writes resolve through requireActiveCompanyId and REFUSE when it is
   unknown. There is deliberately no default and no `?? `: an unresolvable
   company is a condition to surface, never one to guess past. And the company
   id is a REQUIRED positional argument to scopeToCompanyId — not an optional
   field on an options bag — so a caller cannot omit it and silently get
   "every company" (this codebase has pooled Houzs and 2990 data twice for
   exactly that reason). */
