// lead-time.ts — the ONE resolver for "how many days before the customer's
// delivery date must the supplier deliver".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The rule lived in two hand-rolled copies that had
// already drifted on the thing that matters most — error handling:
//
//   scm/routes/mrp.ts            — the MRP order-by HINT (display only).
//                                  Checked the query error. Its comment records
//                                  the scar: a swallowed error "silently zeroed
//                                  EVERY lead time -> order-by date = delivery
//                                  date for the whole plan".
//   scm/routes/mfg-purchase-orders.ts — the PO-from-SO convert, i.e. the code
//                                  that WRITES the date onto a real purchase
//                                  order. DISCARDED the query error.
//
// So the fix landed on the half that only draws a hint and was never applied to
// the half that commits a supplier's delivery date. A transient PostgREST blip
// during a convert (cold start / pooler wobble — both routine here) zeroed every
// lead day, and the PO went out asking the supplier to deliver ON the day the
// customer expects the goods. Silent: the PO looks perfectly normal.
//
// Both callers now come through here, so there is no second copy to drift.
//
// THE MODEL — three additive layers, each with a different owner:
//
//   base     scm.mrp_category_lead_times[(warehouse, category)]
//            The OWNER's manual setting. Authoritative. Nothing in this file,
//            and no agent, may change it.
//   supplier a LEARNED safety buffer per supplier, from how late that supplier
//            actually delivers (agents.procurement.supplierBufferDays).
//   season   a LEARNED safety buffer per calendar month
//            (agents.procurement.seasonBufferDays).
//
//   total = base + supplier + season
//
// Owner's rule, in his words: "我的 Lead Time 都会提早 ... 要根据不同的供应商准时
// 程度、不同的季节以及不同的仓库，来制定提前的 Delivery Date." The warehouse and
// category axes are his manual table; supplier and season are what the agent
// learns. Keeping them as separate ADDITIVE layers (rather than letting an agent
// rewrite his table) means his number always survives, every buffer is
// separately attributable, and any layer can be zeroed without touching another.
//
// The layers are reported broken out (LeadTimeBreakdown) precisely so a proposal
// can say WHY a date moved: "base 7 + supplier 3 (SUP-012 ran 3.2 days late over
// its last 9 receipts) + season 2 (December)". A single collapsed number would
// make the agent unexplainable.
