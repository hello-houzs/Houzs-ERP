// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Oversell (short-shipped) retro-costing — app-layer orchestration + the pure
// reference model of the receipt-time reconcile.
//
// THE BUG (money-critical, owner-approved 2026-07-20). The soft "ship anyway"
// oversell path lets a DO ship more than the warehouse holds. The FIFO trigger's
// fn_consume_fifo costs only what is on hand and discards the qty_short, so the
// short units ship at ZERO recorded cost and inventory_balances goes negative.
// The drop-ship receipt reconcile (fn_reconcile_dropship_batch, 0057/0088) only
// catches this up for is_dropship + batched DOs, so a NORMAL oversold DO is never
// retro-costed: COGS stays understated -> margin OVERSTATED permanently, and the
// signed-balance view diverges from the lot-value view forever.
//
// THE FIX. At GRN receipt (the IN that adds stock) reconcileUncostedOuts calls
// the DB function scm.fn_reconcile_uncosted_out (migration 0154) once per
// received (warehouse, product, variant) bucket. That function consumes each
// prior uncosted short OUT's shortfall from the newly-received open lots (plain
// FIFO, real cost), booking consumptions + restamping the OUT COGS; the caller
// then re-stamps the affected DO lines + Sales Invoices. See 0154 for the full
// mechanism and the anti "coverage-theft" guards.
//
// WHY A DB FUNCTION does the actual consumption: it needs atomic SELECT ... FOR
// UPDATE over the FIFO lots, which PostgREST/supabase-js cannot express. Doing it
// in the app layer would open a money-critical race (two receipts double-
// consuming a lot). The wrapper here only orchestrates (which buckets, the
// receipt cutoff) and collects the affected DOs to re-stamp — mirroring how
// reconcileDropshipBatches wraps fn_reconcile_dropship_batch.
//
// planUncostedRetrocost is the PURE, in-memory mirror of what the SQL function
// does. This repo's vitest harness rebuilds only the D1 side (the scm FIFO layer
// is Supabase Postgres + PL/pgSQL and cannot run under the Workers pool), so the
// SQL itself is untestable here — the model is the executable specification the
// SQL is written against, and what oversell-retrocost.test.ts exercises. KEEP THE
// TWO IN LOCKSTEP: any change to fn_reconcile_uncosted_out must change this too.
//
// SQL-ONLY (no lockstep counterpart): the 2026-07-20 enum-coercion hotfix —
// `UPPER(COALESCE(d.status::text, ''))` in fn_reconcile_uncosted_out (0154) and in
// its already-live sibling fn_reconcile_dropship_batch (0155) — is a Postgres
// plan-time fix only. doStatus is a plain string in this model, so the CANCELLED
// guard below (`(m.doStatus ?? '').toUpperCase()`) never reaches Postgres's enum
// input parser and needs no change. The two stay in lockstep on LOGIC; the ::text
// cast has no behavioural effect to mirror.
