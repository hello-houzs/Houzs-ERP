// deliveryScope.ts — per-assignee row visibility for the Delivery / TMS module.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES (owner rule, Lim Wei Siang): a Driver / Helper may see
// ONLY the delivery jobs assigned to THEIR OWN name (plus their own history),
// and may act (POD / step submit) ONLY on a job they are assigned to. PR #747
// gave Driver/Helper page-level VIEW of the Delivery Planning board
// (scm.transportation.drivers = view) but NO row scope — so a Driver currently
// sees EVERY job on the board, not just their own. This module is the row scope.
//
// TWO SIGNALS, BOTH MUST AGREE BEFORE WE NARROW A CALLER — the conservative,
// no-lockout, no-ops-regression design the go-live charter demands:
//
//   1. INTENT — resolvePositionPolicy (services/positionPolicy.ts, THE one
//      position policy) must classify the caller into the `restricted` cohort
//      (Driver / Helper / Storekeeper / Storekeeper Supervisor — the positions
//      whose page access is confined to the transportation view). We key on the
//      policy's cohort, NOT a raw position_name regex, so a position rename can
//      never silently inject or drop a restriction (the rename hazard the policy
//      itself documents). Anyone the policy leaves at `full`/`sales` — every
//      dispatcher / ops / office / management / sales caller — is UNSCOPED and
//      keeps the whole board, exactly as today.
//
//   2. IDENTITY — the caller must resolve to at least one scm.drivers or
//      scm.helpers row via the `user_id` link (the internal-staff → fleet-row
//      sync: a Driver position upserts scm.drivers.user_id, a Helper/Storekeeper
//      position upserts scm.helpers.user_id). Those linked ids ARE the scope: a
//      job is theirs when its assigned driver/helper id is in this set.
//
// WHY BOTH, AND WHY FAIL OPEN WHEN THEY DISAGREE. The overriding safety rule is
// "must NOT lock a Driver out of their OWN jobs, and must NOT reduce anything
// for full/ops/dispatcher". So:
//   · policy says full but a stray fleet row exists (an ops person once entered
//     as a driver) → NOT scoped → sees all. Ops is never narrowed by accident.
//   · policy says restricted but no fleet link resolves (sync gap, or the link
//     column is absent in a bare test DB, or the lookup errors) → NOT scoped →
//     sees all. A mis-synced Driver is over-exposed exactly as they are TODAY —
//     never LESS than today, so this change can only ever reduce exposure, never
//     lock anyone out. In production the sync guarantees the link, so a real
//     Driver/Helper is scoped.
// The result: we narrow ONLY a policy-restricted caller who has a concrete fleet
// identity — the precise population the owner named — and every other caller,
// and every failure mode, resolves to the pre-existing whole-board view.
//
// UNASSIGNED JOBS. A board row / trip with no driver+helper assigned is NOT any
// one driver's job. A scoped caller does not see it (empty assignment never
// matches a self scope); ops/dispatcher, being unscoped, still do. That matches
// the owner ruling "a random driver no; ops/dispatcher yes".
