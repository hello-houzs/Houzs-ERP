// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Houzs → 2990 Product Maintenance push — pure merge + diff core.
//
// Owner goal (2026-07-17): "我的整个 Product Maintenance 需要传送数据到 POS 系统,
// 给他们去做选择" — the POS staff pick from options maintained in Houzs.
//
// The operative word is 选择 (choose). This module pushes the OPTION LISTS and
// nothing else. It never pushes a price, because of a specific, traced hazard:
//
//   · Houzs writes ONE price (`priceSen` = COST, owner rule 2026-06-22) and
//     deliberately omits `sellingPriceSen` — migrations-pg/0030 says so in as
//     many words.
//   · 2990's POS charges the customer from `sellingPriceSen` ALONE
//     (apps/pos/src/lib/queries.ts:720 `surcharge: Math.round(o.sellingPriceSen
//     ?? 0) / 100`).
//   · 2990's only config write endpoint takes the WHOLE blob, and the POS
//     subscribes to `maintenance_config_history` via Supabase Realtime
//     (queries.ts:1474), so a write reaches the tablets in ~300ms with no
//     deploy and no error.
//
// A naive whole-blob push therefore zeroes 2990's live selling prices, silently,
// on the tablets, mid-sale. That is the `?? 0`-hides-ignorance class this repo
// has already paid for three times in one day. Hence:
//
//   1. READ-MODIFY-WRITE only. `merge()` starts from 2990's OWN blob and adds
//      to it. It never starts from Houzs's.
//   2. For a value present on BOTH sides, 2990's entry is preserved BYTE-FOR-
//      BYTE — we do not even rewrite its label. 2990 owns its retail pricing
//      (D1, originating-system ownership).
//   3. `assertNoPriceLoss()` re-derives every price anchor from the before and
//      after blobs and REFUSES the push if any one of them moved. This is a
//      backstop, not the primary mechanism: if the merge is correct it can
//      never fire. It exists because "the merge is correct" is exactly the
//      assumption that cost us those three bugs. Assert, don't assume.
//
// Nothing here performs I/O. The route (routes/maintenance-push.ts) owns the
// HTTP; this file owns the decisions, so they are unit-testable without a
// network or a database.

/** The pools Houzs is allowed to push: PURE CHOICE-LISTS. Every one of these is
 *  a list of things a POS operator picks from, and none of them carries 2990's
 *  retail price. This allow-list IS requirement 2 ("do NOT push any pool's price
 *  field") expressed as code — a pool absent from here cannot be pushed even if
 *  a caller names it explicitly, because the refusal is generated from this set
 *  rather than from a convention someone has to remember.
 *
 *  Deliberately ABSENT (2990 prices these; a push would be a price write):
 *    divanHeights, totalHeights, legHeights, specials, sofaLegHeights,
 *    sofaSpecials, sofaCompartmentMeta.
 *
 *  Deliberately ABSENT for a different reason — `sizeLabels`. It was in the
 *  original scope for this build, and it is dropped on evidence:
 *    · It is not a list. It is a Record<sizeCode, {label, dimensions}> — a
 *      DISPLAY-LABEL OVERRIDE map (apps/pos/src/lib/products/size-info.ts:48
 *      "Commander edits sizeLabels", apps/api/src/routes/product-models.ts:437).
 *      Nobody picks a sizeLabel. It renames what a size is called.
 *    · Houzs deliberately does not populate it: migrations-pg/0027 says the
 *      "sizeLabels override map is only for commander relabels, so it is NOT"
 *      seeded, and 0029 repeats it. There is nothing on the Houzs side to send.
 *    · Pushing it would overwrite 2990's own labels, which 2990's Commander
 *      maintains — D1 (originating-system ownership) says those are 2990's.
 *  Adding it back is an owner decision, not a code change to slip in. */

// `Console` and adds `CSL` IS a rename, and it is strictly WORSE than the
// cascading one: the cascade at least rewrites the documents to match, whereas
// the blob edit leaves every document still carrying `Console` while the pool
// no longer offers it — orphaned values, no error, no alarm.
//
// We cannot distinguish {rename A→B} from {independent add B, independent
// remove A} by looking at two lists. So we refuse the shape: on
// sofaCompartments, an addition and a removal in the SAME push is refused. Add
// alone is fine. Remove alone is fine. Both together is a rename until the
