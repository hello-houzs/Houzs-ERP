// so-to-do-fields — WHAT AN SO CARRIES INTO A DELIVERY ORDER, in one place.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. There were two SO→DO converters and they disagreed:
//   · POST /delivery-orders-mfg/from-sos loads the source SO header with NO
//     company predicate, deliberately — "a 2990 SO may be converted while
//     browsing as Houzs" (its own comment), because Delivery Planning is a
//     shared cross-company queue.
//   · The Create-DO FORM prefilled itself from GET /mfg-sales-orders/:docNo,
//     which is wrapped in scopeToCompany. A MIRRORED SO carries company_id = 2
//     (so-mirror.ts stamps it), so read while the active company is HOUZS it
//     answered 404 — and the form rendered every header field EMPTY while the
//     "Converted from <doc>" badge and the document-flow strip, both derived
//     from the ?fromSo= query STRING rather than the fetch, kept showing the
//     linkage. Perfect linkage, blank document.
//
// So the column set and the field mapping live HERE and are imported by both
// sides. A field added to the DO snapshot is added once.
//
// NOTHING IS DEFAULTED TO EMPTY. A field the source SO does not carry comes back
// `null`, and `missingSourceFields` names it so the form can say "not on the
// source order" instead of rendering a blank box. `?? ''` here would turn a data
// problem into a silent one and invite someone to retype a customer's address by
// hand.

 * form previews is what the commit would store:
 *   · address2 falls back to address3 + address4 joined (the DO has two address
 *     lines, the SO has four).
 *   · salesperson prefers the human `agent` label and falls back to the id.
 *   · customerSoRef prefers the customer's own SO number over the generic ref.
 * `currency` is the one field with a default, and it is the SAME default the
 * commit applies ('MYR') — not a cover for an unread value.
