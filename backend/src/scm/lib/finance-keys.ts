// finance-keys.ts — the Sales Order finance column vocabulary: the header and
// line keys that may reach ONLY a finance-viewer (lib/houzs-perms.
// canViewScmFinance, mirroring pmsAccess.isFinanceViewer).
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: the list used to be re-declared per route, and every
// copy drifted from the others. #574 (list columns), #600 (DO + SI detail),
// #625 (SO detail), #632 (DR detail) are four instances of ONE bug — "the strip
// was authored for one payload and the sibling never got it". /reports was the
// fifth and widest: it had no copy at all, so it shipped Cost / Margin /
// Margin% for every salesperson's every order, company-wide, to any Sales
// Executive. Keep ONE list, imported everywhere, so a newly-exposed finance
// column cannot be gated on some surfaces and silently open on others.
//
// Adding a column here gates it EVERYWHERE at once. If you add a cost/margin
// column to a SELECT, add its key here in the same PR.

/* PRODUCT / SKU cost — the CATALOG vocabulary, not the document one above.
   mfg_products.cost_price_sen is not derived and is not an artifact: it is
   exactly what someone typed into the SKU master, and it is confidential.
   #669 made it director-only on BOTH screens (desktop ProductModelDetail,
   mobile MobileModuleList + MobileModuleDetail) and named the hole it left in
   its own commit message — "the wire still carries cost_price_sen to any
   products reader (mfg-products.ts has no finance strip)". This list is that
   ruling's payload half, and the gate is the same one the screens use:
   canViewScmFinance ⇄ FE canViewProductCost, both project_finance_viewer.

   ONE key, and that is the point. master_price_history.field stores the COLUMN
   NAME verbatim ('cost_price_sen'), so this same list gates the live column AND
   its history row (stripProductPriceHistory below) — the "stripping the detail
   while leaving the history just moves the leak one endpoint over" shape that
   AUDIT_FINANCE_FIELDS had to be invented to name, closed here by construction
   instead of by a second list that can drift out of sync with this one.

   NOT listed, deliberately: base_price_sen / price1_sen. syncAnchorBindingFromProduct
   calls them a product's COST, so they read like they belong — but #669's
   approved screen prints base_price_sen to EVERY caller ("Price 2" on the Model
   Detail variants table, "Base Price" on the mobile card). Listing them here
   would blank a column the owner ruled visible.

   THE LIMIT, stated so the next reader re-checks rather than re-derives:
   seat_height_prices (JSONB) carries priceSen = COST per height (mfg-products.ts
   PATCH says so verbatim), and it rides the /mfg-products LIST select to every
   caller. It is NOT here because #669 did not rule on it and because the sofa
   pricing chain resolves a CHARGED price through the same cost fields
   (shared/sofa-build.ts: "else flat base_price_sen, else cost_price_sen") — add
   the key blind and a salesperson's build silently reprices. Trace that chain
   first, then add it here and gate it everywhere at once. */
