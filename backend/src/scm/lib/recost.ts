// recost.ts — Costing B (Commander 2026-06-01): retroactive FIFO recost engine.
//
// THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
//   When goods are received (GRN) the FIFO trigger books a lot at the GR price
//   (or 0 if the GR had no price — "Pending"). When that stock later ships on a
//   DO, the trigger consumes the lot and writes the REAL COGS onto the OUT
//   movement (inventory_movements.total_cost_sen) + the consumption row
//   (inventory_lot_consumptions). restampDoActualCost then copies that actual
//   cost onto the DO line (and the Sales Invoice copies the DO).
//
//   But the authoritative cost only arrives LATER, when the supplier's Purchase
//   Invoice is entered — or it gets CORRECTED (human error) by editing the PI or
//   the GR price. The lots, consumptions, movements, DO and SI were all booked
//   at the OLD (or zero) cost and are now wrong.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES (pure backend data updates via the service-role client — NO
// schema migration, the API already runs as SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY):
//   Given a GRN, re-derive the authoritative unit cost per received bucket
//   (PI price > GR price > Pending), then cascade it forward:
//     1. inventory_lots.unit_cost_sen           (the carrying cost)
//     2. the GRN IN movement's unit/total cost  (the lot's source movement)
//     3. inventory_lot_consumptions             (real COGS rows for every OUT)
//     4. the consuming OUT movements' total/unit cost
//     5. restampDoActualCost(DO)                (re-stamp every affected DO line)
//     6. restampSiFromDo(DO)                    (re-copy DO cost onto its SIs)
//
//   The result: a PI entered/edited (or a GR price corrected) AFTER the goods
//   shipped flows all the way down to the DO + Sales Invoice margin in real time.
//
// COST PRIORITY (per line): live (non-cancelled) Purchase Invoice line price,
// else the GR price, else Pending (lot left untouched — cost unknown until a
// price lands; Stage A surfaces this as "Pending"). Each step needs a POSITIVE
// price: 0 encodes "no price known" everywhere else in this schema (the FIFO
// trigger COALESCEs a missing IN cost to 0), so a zero-priced PI line falls
// through to the GR price rather than zeroing a lot that cost real money.
//
// Costs resolve per GRN LINE and are then aggregated onto the lot that line
// produced, identified by (product_code, variant_key, batch_no = source PO).
// Lines that remain tied there are indistinguishable to FIFO too, so they
// resolve to a qty-weighted average — Σ(qty × cost) is conserved exactly.
//
// Best-effort throughout: never throws into the caller (audit-DLQ pattern,
// same as the rest of the inventory layer). The primary write already
// committed; a recost hiccup logs + skips and self-heals on the next touch.

       WHY PER LINE (audit 2026-07-17): lots are one-per-GRN-line (the post writes
       one IN per line; the FIFO trigger opens one lot per IN). Keying cost by
       (material_code, variant_key) alone put every same-SKU line in ONE bucket and
       let the first-read line's price win for ALL of that SKU's lots — so a GRN
       spanning two POs (/from-po-items groups by SUPPLIER, lines keep their own
       purchase_order_item_id) booked the second PO's lot at the first PO's price.

       LOT IDENTITY: nothing links a lot back to its grn_item — inventory_movements
       carries no grn_item_id, only source_doc_id = the GRN. The finest identity the
       schema actually holds is (product_code, variant_key, batch_no), batch_no being
       the source PO number (migration 0120). That separates the multi-PO case
       exactly. Lines still tied on all three are genuinely indistinguishable — FIFO
       itself consumes them in arbitrary order — so they resolve to a qty-weighted
       average, which conserves Σ(qty × cost) EXACTLY (each line's qty IS its lot's
       qty_received). Order-independent, so the resolution no longer depends on the
       row order the DB happened to return.

       COARSE FALLBACK: a lot whose batch_no doesn't match any line's PO (pre-0120
       lots were stamped NULL) falls back to the (code, variant_key) aggregate —

           DOs, nothing will ever revisit that row — the GL is wrong permanently.
