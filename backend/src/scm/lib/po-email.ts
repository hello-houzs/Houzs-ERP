// THIS CHANNEL SENDS TO AN EXTERNAL PARTY. Everything here is written on the

// recalled, so each guard below states what it is protecting against.

/* Attachment cap. Resend's own documented limit is 40 MB across the whole
   message, but the number that matters is smaller and comes from HOOKKA:
   BUG-2026-06-11-015 — its first real customer send claimed "please find
   attached" and arrived with nothing, because the oversize PDF was dropped at
   enqueue AFTER the body had already been rendered. HOOKKA settled on 5 MB
   (PDF_ATTACH_CAP_BYTES) and Houzs matches it deliberately: a PO PDF that
   exceeds 5 MB is a rendering fault, not a big order.

   Houzs's body never promises an attachment (documentEmailHtml inlines the
   summary), so an oversize PDF cannot produce HOOKKA's exact lie. It is still
   REJECTED rather than silently dropped: a supplier who receives a summary
   without the order document has to ask for it, and the operator who pressed
   Send would never learn that the PDF went missing. Loud beats quiet when the
   recipient is external. */

   when a customer lost the mail there was no way to re-send it — a resend
   endpoint had to be retrofitted. A supplier legitimately needs a second copy
   (mail lost, wrong contact, PO amended), so re-sending stays a normal action.

   What is guarded is the accident: two clicks, or a click plus a retry, landing

   its own audit row, so the stamp is "last sent" and entity_audit_log is the
