/**
 * Per-page access model — page catalogue + helpers.
 *
 * Each page has a per-role access entry in `role_page_access`:
 * one of 'none' / 'partial' / 'full'. The `*` wildcard on a role
 * short-circuits the matrix lookup ('full' on every page).
 *
 * Pages with sub-tabs (Projects, Team, Logistics, ASSR, Orders) are
 * modelled as a parent page plus child sub-page entries. The parent's
 * level cascades to children:
 *   parent = "full"    → all children granted at full
 *   parent = "none"    → all children denied
 *   parent = "partial" → child rows take effect; admins pick per child
 *
 * The flattening happens in `loadPageAccessForRole`. Consumers read
 * the flat map `user.page_access` keyed by the leaf page_key
 * (e.g. `projects.calendar`).
 *
 * Phase 1 of the rollout (Sales pilot) shipped. Sub-page splitting
 * shipped 2026-05-12 — Projects' 4 top-level views are wired through
 * `requirePageAccess(...)`; other parents have catalogue entries but
 * their tab-level UI gating lands in follow-up slices.

/**
 * RETIRED KEYS — keys that were once in PAGES[] and have since left it.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIST EXISTS. Deleting a key from PAGES[] does not delete the rows
 * keyed on it. `position_page_access` / `role_page_access` keep them, and both
 * resolvers filter every row through `isValidPageKey` — so the row survives,
 * stops being read, and grants nothing. Nobody is told. The admin's saved
 * configuration silently stops corresponding to anything.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. On 2026-06-13 the owner set "money pages: Finance
 * only" in Team > Positions and saved it correctly. On 2026-06-18 commit
 * 6e59f071 ("chore: remove inert dead code left by the strip-to-core cutover")
 * pruned 14 keys out of PAGES[] as part of a cleanup. Six of them were his:
 * `overview`, `petty_cash`, `orders`, `orders.balance`, `orders.overdue`,
 * `orders.pnl`. His rows were never touched — they just stopped corresponding
 * to a catalogue entry. They are still in prod, still inert, and they are the
 * record of a rule he believes is in force. The editor cannot have caused this:
 * both PATCH endpoints 400 on an unknown page_key (positions.ts:549,
 * roles.ts:281), so an orphan is never an honest save gone wrong — it is always
 * the catalogue moving out from under one.
 *
 * WHAT GOES IN HERE. Any key removed from PAGES[]. `pageCatalogueDrift.test.ts`
 * pins the union of PAGES[] and this list, so a deletion fails CI until the key
 * is named here — which is the point: the failure is the notice nobody got in
 * June. When you add one, say what happened to the rows.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT DORMANT_PAGE_KEYS, and the two must not be conflated:
 *   dormant = the key IS in PAGES[]; it is settable and read by nothing.
 *             The row renders greyed. Fix = wire it, or leave it greyed.
 *   retired = the key is NOT in PAGES[]; rows may still exist and are inert.
 *             There is no cell to render. Fix = migrate the rows, or accept
 *             that they are dead and record why here.
 *
 * INERT BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing reads this at resolve time and nothing may
 * start: `isValidPageKey` must keep returning false for every key here, or the
 * orphan rows would come back to life and silently change who can see what.
 * `pageCatalogueDrift.test.ts` pins that inertness rather than trusting it.

/**
 * DORMANT KEYS — declared here, settable in Team > Positions, and read by
 * NOTHING. Setting one has never done anything, and the UI said "Saved" every
 * time. This is the literal, countable form of the owner's standing complaint
 * "那個設定很多都設定不到", and his ruling on it (2026-07-17) is:
 *   "不能留着了，然后「頁面灰色」点不到吗？最重要是我要它的 UI"
 * — stop pretending they work, grey them out, and KEEP the row: he wants the
 * visual inventory of what the system is MEANT to have. So this list drives a
 * disabled control in the editor, and nothing else.
 *
 * IT CHANGES NO RESOLUTION. `loadPageAccessForRole` / `loadPageAccessForPosition`
 * do not read it; a dormant key still hydrates, still cascades, still resolves to
 * exactly what it resolved to yesterday. It has to be that way — a dormant key
 * may already carry a `= none` row (the seed writes three: hr_manager's
 * `team.roles` + `team.departments`, seed-user-management.mjs:71), and the moment
 * anything READS these keys that row starts 403-ing someone on the Monday after.
 * Greying the editor is the safe half of the ruling; WIRING them is his call and
 * needs his export first.
 *
 * HOW THIS LIST WAS DERIVED, so the next reader re-checks instead of trusting:
 * every `PAGES[].key` grepped across frontend/src + backend/src for a consumer
 * outside this file and positionAccessSnapshot.ts — `<PageGuard page="X">`,
 * `requirePageAccess("X")`, `usePageAccess("X")`, `scmAreaGuard("X")`,
 * `page_access["X"]`, or the key as a literal in any gate. No dynamic key
 * construction exists anywhere (re-verified 2026-07-17 — every lookup helper
 * takes a string and every call site passes a literal), so a literal grep is
 * exhaustive rather than merely suggestive.
 *
 * `team.members` IS THE SEVENTH, and `feat/jd-rules-from-record` counted six.
 * It was missed because the Team nav LOOKS wired: Sidebar.tsx renders
 * /team?tab=members, but that entry gates on `pageAccess: "team"` — the PARENT —
 * plus a flat `users.read`. All four `team.*` children are read by nothing; the
 * tab strip inside Team.tsx calls no page-access hook at all. Same evidence
 * profile as `team.roles` and `team.departments`: catalogue + seed writer + docs,
 * zero gates. If those two are dead, this one is dead by the same test.

 * `positionAccessSnapshot` photograph. A second local implementation of this
 * cascade is the one thing that must not exist — `positions.ts:306-313` already
 * refused to write one for the export's `resolved` map, for the same reason:
 * "a review table that quietly disagrees with login is worse". Two resolvers
 * would have to be PROVEN equal on every cell forever; one resolver fed from
 * two sources reduces that to "are the rows equal", which is a data question a
 * test can answer once. So `explicit[key] ?? out[parent]` lives here exactly
 * once and both callers pass through it.
 *
 * THE FILTER IS PART OF THE SEMANTICS, not hygiene. `isValidPageKey` drops rows
 * whose key left the registry, and `explicitScm` is set INSIDE that guard — so
 * an orphan `scm*` row does NOT mark a caller L2-configured. The snapshot
 * carries its 6 orphan rows verbatim (the export keeps them on purpose:
 * "a photograph that drops them is not a photograph"), so a snapshot-fed caller
 * that skipped this guard would flip `scm_l2_configured` true and backfill every
 * unlisted SCM key to "none" — the mass lockout z1 measured. Sharing the filter
 * is what makes that impossible rather than merely unlikely.
