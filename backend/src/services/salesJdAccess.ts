// salesJdAccess — the Sales cohort's SCM access, keyed off the ORG CHART in
// code, not the RBAC config matrix.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Owner, 2026-07-17: "我説的是用coding 去改backend 而不是整個 …
// 或者你把整個sales department的這個移除掉 根據我們的指令來做 … 那些none的
// 直接不給看 用backend來做." He has said it before, and salesAccess.ts's own
// header already records it: "the owner explicitly wants the Sales cohort's
// visibility driven from the org chart in code (the RBAC-config matrix has
// unresolved issues)". The matrix cannot express what he needs -- 41 nav
// entries already carry hardcoded cohort flags because of it -- so the Sales
// cohort's SCM levels are a RULE, not a setting somebody can mis-click.
//
// THE RULE IS THE JD (owner, same day):
//   "销售部门原本就是卖东西、开 SO 的。如果他们没有开 SO，后面的人怎么去操作呢？"
//   "后面的人是来操作 DO 和 SI 的。销售人员不可能去操作 DO 和 SI，所以他们通常
//    只是来看而已。"
// So: Sales OWNS the Sales Order (edit -- it is the SOURCE document the whole
// chain hangs off; a rep stuck at `view` kills the chain at step one), and only
// LOOKS at what Office operates.
//
// PROVENANCE -- which of these four lines are HIS WORDS, and which are not.
// He is meant to read this file and recognise his own decisions, so the two are
// marked apart rather than blended (`feat/jd-rules-from-record`, 2026-07-17,
// which mined BUG-HISTORY + every merged PR body + the full git log for them):
//   - orders / delivery / invoices  -- QUOTED AND DATED above (owner 2026-07-17).
//   - returns                       -- QUOTED AND DATED as of 2026-07-17. It was
//     carried as UNQUOTED for three days: `feat/jd-rules-from-record` traced it
//     to `hideForSalesNonDirector` -> `hideForSales` in f2ca099 (2026-07-14,
//     PR #417), whose body asserts "deny ALL Sales staff (director too)" and
//     cites no instruction, and flagged it rather than acting on it. Asked
//     directly, the owner confirmed it was his all along:
//       "该关（我确实讲过 / 就是要关）"                    -- owner, 2026-07-17
//     and settled the cohort question the same day:
//       "sales director 算sales"                          -- owner, 2026-07-17
//     So the rule is his, it covers the Director, and it is now ENFORCED rather
//     than merely written (see below). The three-day gap is the lesson: the
//     record could not show the rule, and flagging beat guessing.
//
// WHAT IS ACTUALLY IN FORCE -- measured, because writing a level here is not the
// same as enforcing it (`feat/z1-jd-consolidate`, 2026-07-17, proved this the
// expensive way and its entry is the reason this block exists):
//   - The backend area-guard SKIPS this map unless the caller already holds an
//     explicit `scm*` row (`area-guard.ts` -- the documented NO-LOCKOUT
//     fallthrough). So for a Sales user with NO such row, `"edit"` here grants
//     nothing the coarse `scm.access` umbrella did not already allow, and
//     `"view"` caps nothing.
//   - THE ONE EXCEPTION, and it is deliberate: `salesJdDenial()` below is
//     consulted by the area-guard BEFORE that fallthrough, so a `"none"` in this
//     map is enforced for the cohort whether or not they are L2-configured. That
//     is what makes `scm.sales.returns` a real 403 instead of a hidden nav entry
//     (`feat/dead-cells-and-returns`, 2026-07-17). ONLY the deny half works this
//     way: the `"view"` caps on delivery/invoices are still inert for a non-L2
//     rep, because enforcing THEM would need `scm_l2_configured` forced true,
//     which backfills EVERY unlisted SCM key to "none" and starts enforcing it
//     -- a mass-lockout risk that needs a staging pass, not a merge.
//   - `"none"` still does not hide a nav entry: every SCM entry ORs
//     `anyPerm: ["*","scm.access"]` against `anyAccess`, and `navFilter.ts:81-84`
//     only drops the `scm.access` term when `scm_l2_configured` is true. What
//     hides Delivery Returns in the UI is `hideForSales` on the nav entry plus
//     `DeliveryReturnsGuard` on the route -- both untouched, and both now
//     BACKED by a real gate rather than standing in for one.
//   - Where this map IS load-bearing: the FRONTEND reads it from /auth/me
//     (`quickActionAccess` compares `scm.sales.orders` through ACCESS_RANK
//     against `edit`), and the backend area-guard enforces it for any cohort
//     member who IS L2-configured -- which per z1's measurement includes the
//     Sales Director.
//
// WHY HERE AND NOT IN THE ROUTES. `page_access` is read by BOTH sides -- the
// backend's scm/middleware/area-guard (`user.page_access[area]`, GET/HEAD needs
// `view`, writes need `edit`, "else 403 ENFORCED") and the frontend, which gets
// this same map from /auth/me. Applying the rule once, where the map is built,
// is what stops the two drifting: a rep was being offered a "Create Sales Order"
// button the backend then 403'd, because the FE gate and the BE gate disagreed
// by exactly one level and nothing made them agree.

 *    - returns `none` DENIES him -- enforced, his words, `salesJdDenial()`.
 *    - delivery/invoices `view` CAPS him at read -- and for the Director this is
 *      ENFORCED, not inert: his matrix row `scm.sales = full` (prod snapshot)

 *

 * The header above states it plainly: the `"view"` caps on delivery/invoices
 * "are still inert for a non-L2 rep", because the area-guard SKIPS `page_access`
 * entirely for any caller without an explicit `scm*` row (the NO-LOCKOUT
 * fallthrough). Only the `"none"` half was enforced. That left a real hole:
 *
 *   - A POSITIONED sales rep resolves through positionPolicy, whose scm.sales row
 *     sets scm_l2_configured TRUE, so the `view` cap DID 403 their DO/SI writes.
 *   - A user in a Sales DEPARTMENT with NO position_id hydrates from the legacy
 *     ROLE matrix (auth.ts positionless branch). That branch backfills the scm*
 *     keys owner-only, so they are NOT scm_l2_configured -- and the guard handed
 *     them straight through to POST /delivery-orders-mfg and POST /sales-invoices.
 *     `applySalesJdOverride` wrote `"view"` into their map and nothing read it.
 *
 * So the SAME rule was enforced for one Sales user and theatre for another, which
 * is precisely the failure mode salesJdDenial was written to end. This predicate
 * closes it the same way: consulted BEFORE the no-lockout fallthrough, so the cap
 * holds for every cohort member without forcing `scm_l2_configured` true (which
 * would backfill every unlisted SCM key to "none" and risk the z1 mass lockout).
 *
 * DERIVED FROM SALES_JD, never a second list. An area is write-capped iff the JD
 * puts it at exactly `"view"` -- so `scm.sales.orders` ("edit") is untouched (Sales
 * OWNS the SO and must keep writing it) and `scm.sales.returns` ("none") is already
 * answered whole-method by salesJdDenial above. Adding a `"view"` line to SALES_JD
 * is all it takes to cap a new area; there is nothing here to keep in sync.
 *
 * READS ARE NEVER DENIED -- the method check is first and total. Sales keeps view
 * + Print PDF on DO and SI (both are GETs; the PDFs are rendered client-side from
 * the GET payload), and the `readInheritsFrom: "scm.sales.orders"` hatch in
 * scm/index.ts is untouched, so a rep still reads the DOs and SIs raised off their
 * own Sales Orders. This rule can only ever remove a WRITE.
 *
 * `*` IS EXEMPT, first and unconditionally, and NOBODY OUTSIDE THE SALES COHORT IS
 * TOUCHED -- Office keeps exactly what its position grants. A caller this cannot
 * identify is not denied (fail-OPEN), matching salesJdDenial and moneyWriteDenial:
 * this predicate only ever ADDS a denial on top of gates that already ran.

/**
 * Apply the Sales JD over a hydrated page-access map.
 *
 * SINCE THE FOLD (positionPolicy now owns positioned sales): SALES_JD is the ONE
 * definition of the sales SCM leaf levels, and positionPolicy.ts imports it to
 * build the sales cohort's page-access rows. So for a POSITIONED sales user this
 * override is now IDEMPOTENT -- the policy already produced orders=edit /
 * delivery=view / invoices=view / returns=none, and re-spreading the same values
 * changes nothing (pinned in positionPolicy.test.ts). It is retained on the auth
 * chain for exactly ONE case the position policy structurally cannot reach: a
 * user in a Sales DEPARTMENT with NO position_id, who hydrates from the legacy
 * role matrix (auth.ts positionless branch) and so never runs resolvePositionPolicy.
 * That fallback is the reason this is not deleted -- removing it would drop the JD
 * levels (and the FE quick-action they drive) for a positionless Sales-department
 * user. The DENY half (salesJdDenial) is department-keyed and independent of this,
 * so a positionless user's returns denial is preserved either way.
 *
 * The `*` wildcard (Owner / IT) is exempt and returns UNTOUCHED: it arrives
 * here as fullAccessMap(), and narrowing it would lock the owner out of his own
 * system. Everyone outside the Sales cohort is untouched too -- Office keeps
 * whatever its position grants, which is the whole point of the split.
 *
 * A USER WITH NO POSITION STILL GETS THIS. The cohort test keys off
 * `department_name`, which is populated independently of `position_id`, while
 * `auth.ts:297` hydrates a positionless user from the LEGACY ROLE matrix
 * (`role_page_access`, still live). So a Sales-department user with no position
 * lands here with a role-derived map and has the JD applied on top of it. That
 * is the intended direction (the JD is about the department, not the position
 * row), and it is safe: the role matrix's SCM keys backfill owner-only, so such
 * a user is almost never L2-configured and the deny half stays inert for them --
 * but it means this override must never be written to assume a position exists.
