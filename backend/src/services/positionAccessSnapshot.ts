// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// positionAccessSnapshot — a PHOTOGRAPH of `position_page_access`, generated.
//
// DO NOT HAND-EDIT. DO NOT "fix" a cell that looks wrong to you. Every value
// here was read out of the owner's live rows by a script. If a cell is wrong,
// the TABLE is wrong — change it there and regenerate, or the next regeneration
// silently reverts you.
//
// Regenerate:
//   node backend/scripts/export-position-access.mjs \
//     --input ~/Downloads/houzs-position-access.json
//   
//   (the JSON comes from the Export button on Team -> Positions)
//
// Generated from : https://erp.houzscentury.com (autocount-sync-api.houzs-erp.workers.dev)
// Positions      : 17
// Explicit rows  : 144
// Orphan rows    : 6 (page_key absent from the registry; inert at login)
// Gap cells      : 712 (registry page with no row for that position)
//
// WHY A PHOTOGRAPH AND NOT A REDRAWING. The rules are moving out of this matrix
// and into backend code, one JD at a time (services/salesJdAccess.ts is the
// first). The owner's constraint on that move is the whole acceptance test:
// "如果你能在拆掉的同時，又保持我現在看到的東西和我會 edit 的東西完全不受影響，
// 每一個 position 的數據都保留". He must not re-configure a single cell — so the
// values cannot be inferred from code, reconstructed from git history, or
// recalled from memory. They are read from his rows. On 2026-07-17 a report of
// Sales Director's access made from the code alone was WRONG and he corrected
// it from memory: nav visibility ORs anyPerm/anyAccess (navFilter.ts:76-91) and
// with scm_l2_configured the scm.access term is dropped, so for a non-`*` user
// the matrix cell alone decides. The data is the authority, not the code.
//
// `entries` IS THE EXPLICIT ROWS ONLY — the keys that HAVE a row. A key absent
// from `entries` had NO ROW, which is NOT the same fact as a row of "none":
// loadPageAccessForPosition resolves a child as `explicit[key] ?? out[parent]`
// (pageAccess.ts:748), so absent means INHERIT THE PARENT and "none" means
// DENIED even under a full parent. Anything that consumes this must preserve
// that distinction. Backfilling the gaps to "none" would sever inheritance on
// every child and is exactly the bug this file is built to avoid
// (reference_houzs_nullish_hides_ignorance).
//
// NOT WIRED. Nothing reads this yet. auth.ts still hydrates page_access from
// the live table (auth.ts:295-299) and the matrix is still editable. The
// sequence is deliberate: export -> the owner reviews the table -> he states
// his adjustments -> we encode them -> THEN the switch. Shipping the switch
// before he has reviewed the table is what would force him to reconfigure.
