//      keep working forever, mig 0076 extended the existing ones).
//   3. Staff hits "Sales Portal Link" — same permanent per-case token
//      but source='sales'; the portal renders the salesperson
//      variant (full stage progress, comments attributed to sales).
//
// In all flows the token grants access to ONE case only. The

 * This used to be `cleanPhone(a) !== cleanPhone(b)`, and cleanPhone only
 * strips `+ & - space`. That reconciles punctuation and nothing else, so it
 * could not see across the country-code boundary:
 *
 *     customer types  "012-345 6789"  -> cleanPhone -> "0123456789"
 *     case stores     "+60123456789"  -> cleanPhone -> "60123456789"
 *                                                       ^^ never equal
 *
 * A Malaysian writing their own number writes the leading `0`; the API stores
 * E.164. So the public tracking form rejected the customer's own number and
 * answered "No matching case", which reads as "we have no record of you"
 * rather than "you typed it in the wrong format" — and there is no format
 * hint on the form, because there was not supposed to be a wrong one.
 *
 * normalizePhone() is the module that already knows this mapping (drop the
 * `0`, prepend `60`, keep an explicit `+xx` country code untouched). Running
 * BOTH sides through it makes the comparison format-blind in both directions,
 * which matters because rows written before the normalising write paths
 * existed still hold the local `0…` form.
 *
 * Falls back to cleanPhone equality when normalizePhone declines a value
 * (too short, non-numeric): a legacy row we cannot normalise must still match
 * itself, so this can only ever ADD matches, never remove one that worked.
