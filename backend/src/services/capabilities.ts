// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// capabilities — THE resolved answer set for "what may this user do".
//
// Owner's architectural ruling, 2026-07-19:
//   "我们的权限全部要用 backend 来做，这样子它连渲染都不需要渲染，
//    frontend 那边就不会那么忙。"
//
// The frontend must not COMPUTE a permission. It must be TOLD one. This module
// is where the telling is assembled: one pass, server-side, per /auth/me, that
// turns the raw grants (roles.permissions flat keys + the position policy + the
// stable org fields) into a flat map of BOOLEAN ANSWERS the client consumes
// verbatim.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE OF THIS FILE ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// IT INVENTS NO POLICY. Every predicate below is a COMPOSITION of a function
// that already gates the API — imported, never restated. That is deliberate and
// it is the entire anti-drift mechanism: a capability cannot disagree with the
// gate it describes, because it IS the gate, called with the same caller.
//
// The alternative — restating "isFinanceViewer OR the flat key" here — is what
// this file exists to abolish. It is precisely how the frontend came to have a
// second, staler copy of every rule:
//
//   * SO Maintenance asked `can('scm.config.write')`, the FLAT half only, while
//     the API gate had accepted `flat OR positionPolicy.canWriteConfig` since
//     2026-07-18. Two answers to one question, one on each side of the wire, and
//     the position-granted config writers were shown "Read-only view" over a page
//     whose edits the API would have taken.
//   * `product_cost_viewer` had to be split OUT of `project_finance_viewer` after
//     an owner ruling sat dead for a month because two questions shared one flag.
//
// So: to add a capability, IMPORT the gate and name it. If no backend gate
// exists for the action yet, WRITE THE GATE FIRST and then name it here. A
// capability with no enforcing gate behind it is a UI hint, not a permission,
// and it does not belong in this map.
//
// ── FAILING CLOSED IS MANDATORY ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// There is no `?? true`, no `?? []`, no empty-object default anywhere in this
// path, and there must never be one. `resolveCapabilities(null)` returns every
// capability FALSE — not an empty map, which a client could read as "no rules,
// therefore allowed". An unresolvable capability set is an ERROR to surface, not
// a blank to fill.

   * WHY THIS EXISTS. Four frontend sites — App.tsx SoMaintenanceGuard,
   * MfgSalesOrdersListV2 `canMaintain`, MobileApp's `directorOnly` menu row and
   * its overlay — all gated the page on `isDirectorUser` ALONE. That cohort is
   * {`*`, Super Admin, Sales Director, Finance Manager}. The cohort the API lets
   * WRITE is {`*`, flat-key holders, Procurement/Purchasing, Operation Manager,
   * Operation Executive, Logistic Admin, Super Admin}. The two overlap on Super
   * Admin and `*` and disagree about everyone else, in BOTH directions:

   *   • Sales Director / Finance Manager get IN and cannot write (harmless — they
   *     are the read-only tier, and correct).
   *   • Procurement/Purchasing, Operation Manager/Executive and Logistic Admin —
   *     the very positions the owner ruled on 2026-07-18 must be able to DO the
   *     master-data writes they can see — were bounced to <Forbidden> at the
   *     door. The API would have accepted every one of their edits.
   *
   * Fixing the page's read-only BANNER (fix/so-maintenance-403) does not reach
   * this: the banner is inside a route those positions never get to mount.
   *
   * ADDITIVE BY CONSTRUCTION — a union with the old predicate as one of its two
   * terms, so no user who can open the page today loses it. Non-director SALES
   * stays out, which is the 2026-07-15 ruling: the sales cohort's canWriteConfig
