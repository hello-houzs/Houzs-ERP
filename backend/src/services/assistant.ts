// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// assistant.ts — the unified ERP Assistant + the GCOA routing behind it.
//
// docs/agents/operating-spec.md §2: "Users interact with one unified ERP
// Assistant. The router identifies intent and invokes the appropriate specialist
// Agent." Owner 2026-07-18: build it as an in-system chat first ("先像虎哥这样子"),
// WhatsApp later — the channel changes, this brain does not.
//
// WHAT IT IS: a front desk. It does NOT do the specialists' work. It
//   1. classifies the question → which specialist agent(s) hold the answer,
//   2. FETCHES those agents' own deterministic output (their latest brief + open
//      findings/proposals — already computed, already governed),
//   3. asks the LLM to word ONE answer strictly from those facts.
//
// THE GROUNDING RULE (§1.2: "The LLM interprets, plans, explains and coordinates;
// it does not invent missing operational facts"): the model only ever sees the
// fetched payload, and the system prompt forbids inventing a number that is not
// in it. If the agents hold nothing, the honest answer is "I don't have that",
// never a plausible figure.
//
// READ-ONLY. The assistant never writes a business row and never approves
// anything. A question that implies a write gets an explanation plus a pointer to
// the screen where a HUMAN does it — every write keeps its existing approval path
// (§1.2, and the procurement red line: the agent drafts, a person confirms).
