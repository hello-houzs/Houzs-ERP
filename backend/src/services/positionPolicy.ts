// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// positionPolicy — THE single authoritative position-access policy, in code.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. Owner-directed architecture change (Lim Wei Siang, 2026-07-18):
// stop deriving a position's page access from the `position_page_access` matrix
// TABLE and define it by ONE code policy he directs line by line ("这个有那个没有").
// The end state is a SINGLE rule — not the old matrix AND a separate sales
// mechanism coexisting. This module is that one rule. The matrix stays in the DB
// (its editor + export are untouched) but is no longer READ to resolve access for
// the positions this policy covers; auth.ts asks THIS module.
//
// THE MODEL — default-FULL, restrict only the named cohorts. Owner's interim
// intent: "暂时都可以看到系统里的所有内容". EXCEPT Driver, Helper, Storekeeper,
// Storekeeper Supervisor (an explicit whitelist below) and the Sales tiers, a
// position resolves to fullAccessMap(). A position this module cannot classify
// falls to FULL, never to none — fail OPEN. That is the anti-lockout guarantee:
// "unknown" and "unrestricted" both land on full, so no covered position can
// resolve to an empty map by accident.
//
// SALES IS ONE COHORT IN THIS SAME POLICY — AND NOW RESOLVED HERE. The earlier
// step marked sales a KNOWN cohort but DEFERRED its page-access resolution to the
// legacy matrix (`resolutionDeferred: true`). THIS step folds it in: the four
// sales positions get an explicit page-access whitelist below — their prod rows
// (positionAccessSnapshot) PLUS the imported SALES_JD leaf levels — resolved
// through the SAME resolver the restricted cohort uses, so positionPolicy is now
// the single page-access SOURCE for ALL 17 positions. `resolutionDeferred` is
// gone. What is NOT ripped out, deliberately: the enforcement MECHANISMS that
// derive the non-page dimensions from the same org fields — salesJdDenial (the
// enforced returns 403, still consulted by area-guard + reports.ts), salesScope
// (own+downline row scope), and the pmsAccess/houzs-perms margin+director gates.
// The policy's FLAGS record those decisions (orderScope / canSeeMargin /
// canSeeCommission / announcementScope) and a test pins that the flags AGREE with
// those live helpers for the sales cohort — the policy is the authority, the
// mechanisms are its hands. Proven byte-identical to the pre-fold resolution for
// every sales position (positionPolicy.test.ts, before/after over the snapshot).
//
// scm_l2_configured IS DERIVED HERE, NOT FORCED. A restricted whitelist is fed
// through the SAME resolver the DB path uses (resolvePositionAccessFromRows), so
// its explicit `scm*` rows set `explicitScm` by the identical mechanism the live
// table would have — the restricted cohort is honestly SCM-configured because we
// deliberately configured its SCM areas, and the area-guard therefore ENFORCES
// its `none` denials (without that, step 3 of area-guard.ts falls open to the
// coarse scm.access umbrella and a Storekeeper could write a stock transfer). The
// FULL and fail-open branches leave `explicitScm` FALSE — the same value `*`
// gets — so nothing is force-narrowed: a full position has full on every key and
// the guard has nothing to enforce. This honours "do not force scm_l2_configured"
// where it matters (the full/gap positions, the z1 mass-lockout risk) while still
// enforcing a hand-authored, complete whitelist.

// key that later leaves the registry.
//
// WHY THE L1 AREA KEYS APPEAR HERE. The nav is filtered by navFilter.ts: a node
// shows only if it passes its OWN visibility gate AND (for a group) has a
// surviving child. The top-level "Supply Chain" umbrella's gate is its `anyAccess`
// = the L1 area keys ONLY (`scm.warehouse`, `scm.transportation`, …), and for an
// scm_l2_configured user the `scm.access` permission is STRIPPED from the nav perm
// check — so an L2-only grant (e.g. `scm.warehouse.inventory` alone) leaves the
// umbrella's gate failing and the WHOLE SCM tree is dropped before the leaf is
// reached. So a restricted whitelist must carry the L1 parent of each area it
// grants, at `view`, and then explicitly DENY the sibling children it must not
// open (an explicit `none` overrides the parent's inherited `view`). L1 area keys
// gate NO backend route (routes gate on the L2 keys — verified in scm/index.ts),
// so granting the L1 opens nav visibility WITHOUT opening any write.
//

// /dp-orders, /fleet, /lorry-* backend mount — on `scm.transportation.drivers`

// `scm.transportation` = view inherits `scm.transportation.drivers` = view, which
// shows the board and satisfies the GET reads (it also shows Fleet / Lorry /
// Regions — they ride the SAME key, unchanged from today's Driver/Helper). The
// driver's own POD / delivery-step SUBMIT is a WRITE on that same key and stays a
// follow-up (owner: page-level view now; the "only MY assigned jobs" row-scope +
// step submit is a separate build). Announcements is NOT a page-access key — it

//     payment-vouchers additionally checks flat scm.payment_voucher.* perms, so it

 * (scm/lib/houzs-perms.canWriteScmConfig) — but only the BACKEND evaluated both.
 * SalesOrderMaintenance.tsx asked `can('scm.config.write')`, the flat half alone,
 * so every CONFIG_WRITE_POSITIONS holder (Procurement/Purchasing, Operation
 * Manager / Executive, Logistic Admin, Super Admin) whose ROLE lacks the flat key
 * was shown "Read-only view. Maintenance changes are admin/coordinator-only." on a
 * page whose writes the API would have accepted. That is the exact FE/BE
 * one-level drift salesJdAccess.ts's header warns about, and the fix is the same:
 * decide once, where the rule lives, and let both sides read the answer.
 *
 * Surfaced to the frontend as `scm_config_writer` on GET /api/auth/me, beside
 * project_finance_viewer / product_cost_viewer, which exist for this same reason.
 *
 * ORDER MATTERS ONLY FOR COST: the wildcard and the flat key are cheap set reads;
 * resolvePositionPolicy is last. Fails CLOSED on an unidentifiable caller.
