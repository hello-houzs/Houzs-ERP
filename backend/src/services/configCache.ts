// Scope-keyed read cache for hot, read-mostly CONFIG endpoints.
//
// Two storage tiers, ONE invalidation mechanism:
//
//   - Cache API (caches.default) for responses shared by everyone in the SAME
//     scope — today that scope is a COMPANY (/api/branding per companyCode,
//     /api/scm/maintenance-config/resolved per active companyId). The scope
//     value is a REQUIRED parameter embedded in the synthetic cache-key URL:
//     there is no keyless overload and no default, because a cache key that
//     silently omits its scope dimension is a cross-company data leak — the
//     exact class the multi-company hardening is fighting. A caller whose
//     scope is UNRESOLVED (pre-migration / cold-start / restricted-to-nothing)
//     must BYPASS the cache entirely, never guess a scope.
//
//   - SESSION_CACHE KV for PER-USER payloads (the announcements banner),
//     keyed by user id — the inbox snapshot pattern (routes/inbox.ts).
//     Per-user data must never enter the shared Cache API.
//
// Invalidation = a monotonic VERSION SEGMENT in KV, one per family. Every
// cache key embeds the family's current version; a write path bumps the
// version, which orphans every existing entry at once (they then expire by
// their own TTL). Chosen over cache.delete() because caches.default is
// PER-COLO: a delete only purges the datacenter that ran the mutation, while
// a KV bump propagates to every colo within KV's ~60s global window — and
// immediately in the writing colo, so the editor sees their own change on the
// very next read. Worst-case staleness after a write is bounded by
// max(KV propagation, entry TTL); there is no stale-forever state.
//
// Pure optimization layer (sessionCache.ts's philosophy): every operation is
// wrapped, so KV unbound (local dev without the binding) or any KV / Cache
// API error just BYPASSES caching and serves today's DB path unchanged. On
// *.workers.dev hosts the Cache API is a documented no-op — match always
// misses, put is ignored — which degrades to the same bypass.
