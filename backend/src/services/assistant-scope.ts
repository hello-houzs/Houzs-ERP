// assistant-scope.ts — who may ask the Assistant what, and which numbers reach
// the model at all.
//
// The Assistant is owner-only today (requirePermission("*")) for one reason: the
// specialists' briefs carry margin and per-salesperson performance, and a single
// prompt would hand those to anyone who could open the page. This module is the
// part that has to exist BEFORE it can be opened to staff.
//
// TWO AXES, and the second is the one that matters:
//   1. CAPABILITY — which specialists a caller may consult at all.
//   2. FIELD — which numbers survive into the payload.
//
// Redaction happens at GATHER, before the model is called. Showing a model the
// margin and instructing it not to repeat the margin is not a control; it is a
// request. A number the caller may not see must never enter the context window,
// because prompt text is advisory and a context window is not.
//
// NO NEW POLICY IS INVENTED HERE. The three flags come from positionPolicy, which
// the owner already approved and which every other surface obeys — this file
// applies them to a new surface rather than authoring a second rulebook. That
// matters: a second rulebook is how "Sales cannot see margin" ends up true on four
// screens and false on the fifth.

 * "full" (positionPolicy.ts:602-618, "FAIL OPEN ... the anti-lockout
 * invariant"), which carries canSeeMargin + canSeeCommission + orderScope
 * "all". So creating a new position — say a Sales title that does not begin
 * with the word "Sales" — silently granted its holders margin, commission and
 * the whole Assistant from the moment the row was saved. That is the owner's
 * concern and it is real.
 *
 * The Assistant now fails CLOSED on an unrecognised name: unknown -> denied.
 * Deliberately scoped to THIS surface only. The global position default is NOT
 * flipped here — doing that repo-wide is the anti-lockout invariant above and
 * needs its own change with the owner's sign-off.
 *
 * CONSEQUENCE THE OWNER MUST KNOW: adding a position to the live table no
 * longer grants the Assistant. The name has to be added here too. That is the
 * trade — a new position starts with no Assistant instead of starting with
 * everything.
 *
 * Provenance: services/positionAccessSnapshot.ts, the generated photograph of
 * the owner's live rows (17 positions). Copied rather than imported because
 * that file is explicitly NOT WIRED — nothing reads it yet, and making this the
 * first consumer would couple a security gate to a file whose header says it is
 * a reviewable draft. Regenerate that snapshot, then update this list.
