// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// procurement-agent.ts — the Houzs Procurement Agent's deterministic ENGINE: an
// MRP-driven reorder sweep. The owner asked for the HOOKKA flow — "run MRP,
// then propose POs to suppliers." This engine runs the SAME allocation the SCM
// MRP page uses (computeMrp), and when supplier-binding coverage across the
// shortage SKUs is high enough, emits one per-supplier REORDER proposal.
//
// The engine only:
//   1. runProcurementAgent — runs MRP, applies the readiness gate, and (when
//      not gated) writes PENDING REORDER rows into procurement_agent_proposals
//      (migration 0096), one per supplier that owns shortage SKUs. It also
//      writes ONE deterministic snapshot into procurement_agent_briefs.
//   2. procurementAgentStatus — cheap counters for the console card (must not
//      throw before the migration has been applied).
//
// RED LINES (enforced structurally):
//   - PROPOSAL-ONLY, never a PO. This module NEVER creates or edits an
//     scm.purchase_orders row. Its proposals live in procurement_agent_proposals
//     (public schema), which is EXACTLY why MRP never double-counts them: MRP's
//     supply calc only reads real, non-DEAD scm POs, so a pending reorder can't
//     leak back into next run's poOutstanding. On approval the office raises the
//     real PO through the existing SO->PO converter.
//   - Auto-send (email / WhatsApp to the supplier) is OUT OF SCOPE for this
//     file — a documented later step. Nothing here contacts a supplier.
//   - Deterministic — no LLM calls, no invented numbers. MrpSku carries no cost,
//     so proposals are QUANTITIES + DATES only; cost/value estimation is a later
//     enhancement (brief.estimatedValueSen is left null to mark the seam).
//   - Money would be integer sen if it existed here — but it does not yet.
//
// READINESS GATE (ships first, on purpose): supplier bindings/costs are not
// fully seeded on the SCM catalogue yet, so a low-coverage run would propose
// reorders for only the handful of SKUs that happen to have a main supplier and
// silently drop the rest. Instead the engine computes coverage = (shortage SKUs
// with a main supplier) / (all shortage SKUs) and, when it falls below
// minCoveragePct (app_settings['agents.procurement'], default 90), creates NO
// proposals and records why. Reorder proposals unlock once coverage is high.
//
// DB access, following house patterns:
//   - scm data (MRP allocation) → getSupabaseService(env) (PostgREST), read via
//     computeMrp so the agent and the MRP page can never disagree.
//   - public tables (procurement_agent_*, app_settings) → env.DB (d1-compat
//     shim over postgres.js). Rows read off env.DB are read snake_case as-is,
//     matching the sibling agent engines.

     The agent thinks in SKUs ("MAT-QUEEN is 40 short"); the SO->PO converter
     takes SO LINE ids. Nothing mapped between them, so an approved proposal was
     a worklist tick and a human retyped it into the picker by hand.

     MRP already carries the bridge — every MrpLine has `soItemId` ("lets the UI
     one-click PO this line"). These are exactly the shape POST /from-sos wants,
     so approval can hand them straight to the SAME converter a human uses:
     identical supplier resolution, combo redistribution, per-category split and
     lead-time derivation. A separate agent-only PO writer would have been a
     second implementation of all of that, and the two would have drifted.

     `supplierId` is deliberately NOT sent. The agent grouped these by the SKU's
     main supplier, and the converter resolves the main supplier itself — from
     the bindings as they are AT EXECUTION TIME, not as they were when the
     proposal was written. Fresher, and it avoids the converter's documented
     fall-through (naming a supplier with no binding for that SKU silently lands
     the line on the main supplier anyway). The proposal's supplierCode is the
     agent's reasoning, not an instruction. */
