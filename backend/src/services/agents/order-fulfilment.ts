// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// order-fulfilment.ts — the OF-001 readiness assessment, as pure policy.
//
// docs/agents/operating-spec.md §3 (Order Fulfilment Agent): "checks that every
// Sales Order has complete commercial and fulfilment information, determines
// sourcing/production/stock readiness … Identify the precise blocker, responsible
// owner and next required action … present one truthful order status." §3.7
// required outputs: an order readiness score + blocker list, a next-action task
// with owner, and an achievable delivery-ready date.
//
// The signals ALL exist already, scattered — this composes them into ONE verdict
// so no screen has to re-derive "is this order ready, and if not, who owns the
// fix":
//   • stock       — scm/lib/so-readiness.ts (summariseReadiness → isMainReady)
//   • payment      — services/agents/release-gate.ts (RELEASE / HOLD)
//   • order data   — scm/shared/order-rules.ts (the meetsProceedGate inputs)
//   • SO status    — delivery-orders-mfg.ts SO_UNDELIVERABLE_STATUSES
//   • supply date  — mrp.ts computeMrp (achievable ready date; the CS agent's Job A)
//
// Pure: no DB, no LLM. It takes primitive signals (not table rows) so it stays
// decoupled from every caller's query shape, and every branch is unit-testable.
// It COMPUTES readiness; it does not release delivery, change price, create the
// task, or move a date — those are other agents' authority (spec §3.6 exclusions).
