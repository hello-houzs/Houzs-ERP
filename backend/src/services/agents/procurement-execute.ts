// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// procurement-execute.ts — what an APPROVED reorder proposal actually does.
//
// Split out of routes/agent-console.ts because two callers need it and they
// have nothing else in common:
//   - the console's approve button, acting AS the human who clicked it;
//   - the full-auto path (owner's Stage 2), acting as a staff member he has
//     explicitly nominated.
// Leaving it in the route would have forced the headless caller to fake a Hono
// context, which is exactly the mistake companyDocPrefix's comment records
// ("[object Object]-SO-2607-001").
//
// THE RED LINE, restated because this file is where it looks like it moves:
// procurement-agent.ts (the ENGINE) still never touches scm.purchase_orders. It
// proposes. This module executes a DECISION someone made about a proposal, and
// what it creates is a DRAFT PO that a human must still confirm. Approve, then
// confirm — two gates. Turning the auto-approve gate on removes the FIRST gate,
// never the second: nothing here can put a PO in front of a supplier.
