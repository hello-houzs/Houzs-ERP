// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// procurement-learning.ts — the Procurement Agent's LEARNER: how much earlier
// must we ask each supplier to deliver, so the goods are actually in the
// warehouse before the customer's date?
//
// Owner's standing rule, verbatim (2026-07-17):
//   "我的 Lead Time 都会提早。因为有些 Supplier 会迟送货 ... 如果不提早，一旦供应商
//    迟到，我们就完蛋了。因此，我们必须提早送货，并且要根据不同的供应商准时程度、
//    不同的季节以及不同的仓库，来制定提前的 Delivery Date。"
//
// The warehouse and category axes are his MANUAL table (scm.mrp_category_lead_
// times). This file learns the two axes he cannot maintain by hand — supplier
// punctuality and season — and proposes them as CONFIG PROPOSALS he approves.
// It never writes his table, and it never writes a PO. See scm/lib/lead-time.ts
// for how the layers add up.
//
// ── WHAT IS MEASURED ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//   sample  = a purchase order that reached status RECEIVED
//   asked   = purchase_orders.expected_at   (the date we asked for)
//   actual  = the receipt date of the GRN that completed it
//   slip    = actual - asked, in whole days. Positive = the supplier was late.
//
// `expected_at` is the ORIGINAL ask, deliberately — NOT effectiveDelivery().
// The supplier_delivery_date_2/3/4 push-backs are the supplier TELLING US they
// will be late; measuring against them would score a supplier on hitting their
// own revised promise and quietly forgive every push-back. The question this
// learner answers is "if I ask for date D, when do the goods actually turn up",
// so the original ask is the only honest denominator.
//
// ── WHY THIS DOES NOT RUN AWAY (read before changing anything) ─────────────
// The obvious fear with a self-tuning buffer is the feedback loop: add buffer ->
// ask earlier -> supplier has less time -> slips more -> add more buffer ->
// forever.
//
// It does not happen here, and the reason is structural. The SAME lead number
// drives BOTH sides: MRP's order-by hint (mrp.ts orderByOf) and the PO's asked
// delivery date (mfg-purchase-orders.ts) are both `customerDate - lead`. So a
// bigger lead moves WHEN WE ORDER and WHEN WE ASK earlier by the same amount.
// The supplier's own turnaround is untouched, so `slip` is invariant under the
// buffer and the loop settles instead of climbing.
//
// That invariance is a property of the current wiring, not a law. If anyone ever
// makes the order-by date and the asked date use different leads, this learner
// CAN run away and must be re-derived. Belt and braces meanwhile: the rule's
// `max` caps any single value, and every change is a proposal a human approves —
// a climbing series (+3, +6, +9) is visible in the console before it is real.
//
// ── WHY p75 AND NOT THE MEAN ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// The owner is protecting against a tail, not an average: "一旦供应商迟到，我们就
// 完蛋了". Buffering to the mean is late half the time by construction. But
// buffering to the worst case orders everything far too early, which lands stock
// in the warehouse to rot — the very turnover he is trying to optimise with the
// mattress merge rule. p75 is the deliberate middle: cover three receipts in
// four, and let him move it. Configurable, because it is a business judgement
// about how much stock he will hold to avoid how many late deliveries, and that
// is his call, not a constant.
