/* Session ORIGIN (mig 0120) — the DOOR a session was minted at. It is NOT a

   both for the SAME public.users row. That is precisely why the POS pricing
   envelope (scm/routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts isPosTabletCaller) cannot be
   derived from the user, their position, or their scm.staff role — only from
   the session.

   WHY IT IS UNFORGEABLE: the value is chosen server-side by whichever route
   calls createSession, and stored on the session row. It never appears in a
   request, so a caller can no more assert its origin than it can assert its
   own user_id. Holding a 'pos' session requires passing the PIN gate at
   /api/pos/pin-login; a client cannot opt OUT of one either, because omitting
   something it never sent changes nothing. This is the property the
   self-asserted `X-Client` header it replaced never had.

   `undefined` (every non-POS door) stores NULL, which reads as not-POS — the
   pre-migration behaviour, and the safe direction. Keep this a closed union:
