// Project-detail (PMS) section-level access — port of the reference repo's
// src/lib/pms-access.ts, adapted to the production AuthUser + projects model.
//
// This layers ON TOP of two existing gates:
//   1. the page matrix (projects.list) — can you open the project area at all
//   2. getProjectScope() (projectAcl.ts) — PIC + brand row filter on WHICH
//      projects you can see
// pmsAccess then decides WHICH SECTIONS of a project's detail page render, and
// crucially hides the financial snapshot + rental amount from everyone except
// directors/finance. See docs/PERMISSION-MATRIX.md (PMS section table).
//
// PIC is a PER-PROJECT assignment (projects.pic_id === user.id), NOT a job
// title — a sales person is "PIC" only on the projects they're assigned to.
