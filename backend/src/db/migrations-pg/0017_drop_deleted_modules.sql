-- Strip-to-core cutover: drop the tables owned ONLY by the deleted modules
-- (Operations/fleet leaf data, Engagement/gamify, Petty Cash, Overdue history).
--
-- IRREVERSIBLE on prod (PITR is off). Runs on the next deploy via
-- scripts/pg-migrate.mjs. Every table below was verified to have ZERO
-- references from the retained code (Service/QMS, Projects, People, Settings,
-- and the shared search / inbox / notifications / events / users infra).
--
-- DELIBERATELY RETAINED (the retained modules still read these, so they are
-- NOT dropped here): trips, trip_stops, lorries (events calendar + inbox +
-- global search), sales_orders, order_details, creditors, purchase_orders,
-- purchase_order_docs, warehouses (ASSR cost-suggestion / by-creditor / search),
-- sales_reps + sales_* (Projects sales attendees + rep picker), and the
-- users.points_balance / users.current_streak COLUMNS (the notifications
-- snapshot reads them — only the point_transactions ledger table is dropped).

-- Operations / fleet — leaf children only (parents trips/trip_stops/lorries kept)
