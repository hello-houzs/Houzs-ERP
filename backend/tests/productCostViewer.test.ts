/* Owner 2026-07-17, shown that his 2026-06-13 red line ("Only Purchasing +
   Finance see cost") was not in force because Purchasing is in no cost cohort:
   "那就是采购、Finance，还有 Sales Director 啊？"

   The cost question rode `project_finance_viewer`, which answers "are you a PMS
   DIRECTOR". Two questions, one flag — so restoring Purchasing to the cost
   cohort by widening that flag would ALSO have handed him every project's
   financials and made him a director. These lock BOTH halves: that Purchasing
   gains cost, and that he gains nothing else. The second is the acceptance
   test — widening a gate is the direction that leaks. */
