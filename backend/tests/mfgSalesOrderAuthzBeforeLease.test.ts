/* REGRESSION — a permission refusal must never be reported as a concurrency
   conflict (defect 4, 2026-07-22).

   Making the edit lease mandatory put `requireSoLineWriteLease` at the TOP of
   every SO line-mutation handler, ahead of that handler's authorization gate.
   A caller who is not allowed to touch the order at all therefore received
   409 `so_edit_lease_conflict` — "This order is being saved on another screen.
   Your changes are still here. Wait a moment, then try Save again." That
   sentence is an instruction to RETRY, so the operator retries forever, and the
   true reason (no permission / not your order / admin-only price override)
   never reaches them or the logs.

   The rule this test pins: within a handler, the AUTHORIZATION decision comes
   first and the CONCURRENCY decision second. Authorization does not depend on
   who currently holds the lease, so ordering it first costs nothing and is the
   only ordering that can report the real reason. */
