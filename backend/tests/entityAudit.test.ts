   recordEntityAudit itself is NOT unit-tested: it is a thin insert against
   Postgres via the scm supabase client, and the scm tree does not ride the D1
   harness the rest of this suite uses (vitest.config.ts pins DATABASE_URL="" and
   applies src/db/migrations to an isolated D1; scm lives in Postgres under the
   `scm` schema, reached through Hyperdrive). There is no route-level harness for
   /api/scm/* and faking one would test the fake. What IS testable is every pure
   decision the writer delegates — which changes get recorded, in what shape, and
   whether a value counts as changed at all — so that is what this covers. */
