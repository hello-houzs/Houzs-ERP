/* ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   THE CATALOGUE PIN — what this file is for, and why a count was not enough.

   Deleting a key from PAGES[] does not delete the rows keyed on it. The rows
   stay in `position_page_access` / `role_page_access`, both resolvers drop them
   through `isValidPageKey`, and the admin who saved them is told nothing. That
   is what happened on 2026-06-18: 6e59f071 pruned 14 keys as dead code and six
   of the owner's saved cells became orphans that same afternoon.

   The mechanism was NOT unguarded before this file — but the guard was an
   accident. positionAccessSnapshot.test.ts pins counts (PAGES.length = 50,
   orphans = 6, cells = 850), and because all 50 keys happen to have a row in the
   prod photograph, deleting any one of them did go red. It went red saying
   "expected 49 to be 50" under a suite named "the snapshot's shape matches what
   its header claims". A count that reads as bookkeeping about a generated file
   has exactly one obvious remedy — update the number — and taking it re-commits
   the June bug with a green tick. The guard has to name the key and say what
   deleting it costs, or it is just a speed bump on the way to the same place.

   So: the union of PAGES[] and RETIRED_PAGE_KEYS is pinned as a SET. A number
   cannot be nudged to make this pass. Removing a key fails until it is named as
   retired; the record of what left, and why, accumulates instead of evaporating.

   ONE CATALOGUE, TWO MATRICES. `role_page_access` and `position_page_access` are
   different tables with different level vocabularies, but both validate and
   resolve against this same PAGES[] (roles.ts:281, positions.ts:549). So the
   prune hazard is shared, and pinning the catalogue once covers both. The prod
   photograph only covers positions — the role matrix has no snapshot and never
   had even the accidental cover — which is the other half of why the pin lives
   here rather than in the snapshot suite.

const FIX_INSTRUCTIONS = `
A page key left PAGES[] (or arrived in it) without the bookkeeping that keeps
saved access rows honest.

If you REMOVED a key: the rows keyed on it are still in position_page_access and
role_page_access. They are not deleted, they are orphaned — the resolvers skip
them, they grant nothing, and the admin who saved them is never told. This is
the 2026-06-18 bug (6e59f071) that cost the owner six cells he still believes
are in force. Decide, and record the decision:
  - the rows should keep working  -> migrate them to the new key in a migration
                                     (STAGING first), then retire the old key
  - the rows are genuinely dead   -> add the key to RETIRED_PAGE_KEYS in
                                     services/pageAccess.ts, with a note saying
                                     what happened to the rows
Then add the key to EVER_KNOWN_PAGE_KEYS here if it is somehow missing.

If you ADDED a key: append it to EVER_KNOWN_PAGE_KEYS above. That is all — the
list is how the next deletion gets caught.

Do NOT "fix" this by deleting the key from EVER_KNOWN_PAGE_KEYS. That is the
same silence, one layer up.
