   SO MAINTENANCE — the page's own reference reads must be REACHABLE.

   The owner opened /scm/sales-orders/maintenance in production and three of its
   seven reads came back 403, twice each:
       GET /inventory/warehouses
       GET /delivery-planning-regions
       GET /delivery-planning-regions/states
   while venues, so-dropdown-options and state-warehouse-mappings loaded fine on
   the same page load. The asymmetry was the whole clue: the four that worked are
   mounted as cross-area REFERENCE reads (coarse umbrella, or openRead), and the
   three that failed were gated on two unrelated ADMIN areas — scm.warehouse.
   inventory and scm.transportation.drivers — that this page is not.

   These drive the REAL middleware on the REAL mount strings from scm/index.ts
   and assert HTTP status, following scmReturnsGuard.test.ts: proving the option
   is set and proving the door opens are two different claims.

   THE CALLER UNDER TEST is deliberately the WORST case that should still be able
   to read this page: scm_l2_configured, with `none` on both admin areas and no
   `*`. If that caller gets through, every wider one does. `*` is not the
   interesting case — area-guard.ts:101 has always short-circuited it.
