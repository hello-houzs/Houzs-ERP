// It is wired into `npm run test:scale-contract`, which is `pretest`, so it runs
// on every CI backend job.
//
// NO DEPENDENCIES: node:test / node:assert only. `npm install` in a worktree
// destroys the main checkout's node_modules, so a check that needs one is a
// check nobody runs.
//
// The gate this covers exists for ONE reason — a route's GATE changing must be
// noticed — and it was made quieter, so the half of this file that matters most
// is the half proving it still fails on every authorization change.
