   — a switch that does nothing must stop pretending, must be unclickable, and
   the ROW MUST STAY. DORMANT_PAGE_KEYS is how the editor knows which rows to
   grey.

   THE ACCEPTANCE TEST IS THAT NOTHING MOVES. Greying is a UI fact; hydration
   must not learn about it. These pin that the resolvers are blind to the list —
   a dormant key with a `= none` row still resolves to exactly "none", and a
   dormant key riding its parent still inherits. If greying ever starts changing
   what a cell resolves to, this file fails before anyone is locked out on the
   Monday after. */
