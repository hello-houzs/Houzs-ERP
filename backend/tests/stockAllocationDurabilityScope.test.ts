/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   SCOPE LEDGER for the durable allocation queue (defect 1, 2026-07-22).

   HONEST STATEMENT OF WHAT SHIPPED. The durable outbox introduced by this PR
   covers FOUR of the THIRTY-EIGHT places that trigger an SO stock-allocation
   recompute. The other thirty-four still call `recomputeSoStockAllocation`
   inline, best-effort: if the Worker dies, the network drops, or the CPU limit
   is hit between the source write and the recompute, the projection stays stale
   until the next unrelated mutation happens to sweep it. Allocation is
   therefore NOT durable in general, and nothing in this repo should be read as
   claiming it is.

   WHY THE REMAINING 34 WERE NOT CONVERTED HERE. `enqueueStockAllocationRecompute`
   is only a durability guarantee when it commits in the SAME database
   transaction as the source write. Only the four converted call sites run under
   `runScmPgCommand`; the rest are ordinary PostgREST route bodies with no
   transaction to join, so enqueuing there would produce a queue row that can
   commit without its source write (or vice versa) — a WORSE lie than the honest
   best-effort call that is there now. Converting them means first moving each
   route onto the PG command transaction, which is a separate project per
   module. Doing it inside this PR — already the largest concurrency change in
   the batch, with no PostgreSQL CI coverage for the scm path — would not be
   reviewable.

   THIS TEST IS A RATCHET, NOT A TARGET. It pins the exact inventory. Converting
   a call site (count moves from `inline` to `durable`) or adding a new one both
   fail this test, which forces the follow-up PR to state which line it changed
   instead of letting the numbers drift quietly. Follow-up work: convert by
   module, highest count first (grns 6, mfg-sales-orders 8), each with its own
   move to `runScmPgCommand`.
