# SCM VIEW-TRAP — defensive CoE (Houzs port of 2990's 2026-06-26 incident)

**Status:** PREVENTIVE (no Houzs prod incident yet). **Authored:** 2026-06-29.
**Origin:** 2990 prod hit this 2026-06-26 (`docs/2026-06-26-so-list-view-trap-coe.md`)
when a shared SO HEADER select constant was extended with new base-table
columns. Houzs SCM is a 1:1 clone of 2990's furniture SCM, so the SAME class
of bug can land here. This doc captures the pattern + the Houzs-specific
guard so it never does.

## 1. The trap, in one paragraph

`scm.mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals` is a Postgres VIEW. Postgres
**freezes** a view's output column set at `CREATE VIEW` time — even when the
view body says `SELECT so.*`. After that, an `ALTER TABLE
mfg_sales_orders ADD COLUMN x` does NOT flow through to the view. Any code that
selects `x` via the view gets back `column ... does not exist` → PostgREST 500
→ the SO LIST page renders "Failed to load." for every user.

The fatal shape is:

| Read | Source | Knows new columns? |
|---|---|---|
| SO **detail** GET (`/:docNo`) | `from('mfg_sales_orders')` (BASE TABLE) | YES — `ALTER TABLE` added them |
| SO **list** GET (`/`) | `from('mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals')` (VIEW) | NO — view frozen at creation |

When ONE shared `HEADER` SELECT string feeds BOTH reads, adding a column to
HEADER is fatal for the list read unless the view is recreated in the same PR.

## 2. Houzs current state (verified 2026-06-29)

- The view was created by `backend/scripts/scm-schema/apply-scm-views.mjs`,
  which pulls 2990's view-creating migrations in numeric order. The LAST one
  it applies for this view is 2990's mig `0155_so_sku_p2_service_bucket_skus_deposit.sql`,
  which DROP + CREATE the view as `SELECT so.*` (plus `paid_total_centi` +
  `balance_centi_live` computed cols). It does NOT apply 2990's later fixes
  (`0193_currencies_master.sql`, `0200_recreate_so_payment_view.sql`,
  `0201_amend_reason.sql`).
- Houzs has since added columns to `scm.mfg_sales_orders` via local migrations
  `0033_so_scan_slip_image.sql` (`slip_image_key`), `0034_so_scan_receipt_image.sql`
  (`receipt_image_key`), and `0053_scm_delivery_planning_tms.sql`
  (`delivery_state`, `possession_date`, `house_type`, `replacement_disposal`,
  `referral`, `amend_date_from_customer`, `amended_delivery_date`,
  `amend_reason`). NONE of these are visible through the view.
- The `HEADER` constant at `backend/src/scm/routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts` does
  NOT reference any of those new columns. **No active drift. No live 500.**
- The detail-only columns (`slip_image_key`, `receipt_image_key`,
  `proceeded_at`, `signature_b64`, `slip_key`, `slip_state`) are appended on
  the BASE-TABLE detail read at the `/:docNo` handler, NEVER on HEADER. That
  is exactly the 2990 pattern (P-2 below).
- `backend/src/scm/routes/delivery-planning.ts` reads the SO header off the
  BASE table `mfg_sales_orders` (safe) and only hits the view for one
  view-native column (`balance_centi_live`). Also safe.

## 3. The two at-risk select strings (where inline guards now live)

1. `backend/src/scm/routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts` — the `HEADER` constant
   (definition site) AND the `LIST_COLS` select against the view. Both
   carry an inline `VIEW-TRAP` comment block pointing here.
2. `backend/src/scm/routes/delivery-planning.ts` — the
   `mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals` select inside `loadRegionConfig`
   call site. Carries an inline `VIEW-TRAP` comment pointing here.

If a third route grows a view-backed select, copy the comment block from the
first call site and grep for it on review.

---

## 4. Prevention rules (Houzs-flavoured P-1..P-5)

**P-1 — Recreate the view in the SAME migration that adds a column you intend
to expose via the view.** Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW
scm.mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals AS SELECT so.* …` (preserves grants;
`so.*` re-expands at the recreate, picking up every base-table column at that
moment). The new mig number is just the next free Houzs PG mig number.

**P-2 — Detail-only fields stay OUT of HEADER.** Append them on the BASE-TABLE
detail SELECT only. Houzs already does this for `slip_image_key`,
`receipt_image_key`, `proceeded_at`, `signature_b64`, `slip_key`, `slip_state`,
and the 8 cols from mig 0053 (`delivery_state`, `possession_date`, `house_type`,
`replacement_disposal`, `referral`, `amend_date_from_customer`,
`amended_delivery_date`, `amend_reason`).

**P-3 — `SELECT so.*` is NOT auto-tracking.** It is frozen at the last
`CREATE VIEW` just like an enumerated list. Don't rely on `so.*` to "see"
new columns without a recreate.

**P-4 — When you write `ALTER TABLE scm.mfg_sales_orders ADD COLUMN`, grep for
dependent views.** `grep -rn "FROM scm.mfg_sales_orders\b\|from('mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals')" backend/src` → if anything matches, decide:
recreate the view (if the list needs the col) OR keep it detail-only (P-2).

**P-5 — `pg_get_viewdef('scm.mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals'::regclass, true)`
is the source of truth.** Don't trust the migration ledger; pg-migrate has had
duplicates (CLAUDE.md). Before assuming a view carries a column, read its live
definition against prod.

## 5. Houzs checklist for any change that touches the shared `HEADER`

- [ ] Did I add a column to `HEADER` in `backend/src/scm/routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts`?
- [ ] Is that column actually exposed by `scm.mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals`?
      (`pg_get_viewdef` on prod, or check the LAST recreate-view migration.)
- [ ] If NOT exposed, did I ship a Houzs PG migration in the SAME PR that
      `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW scm.mfg_sales_orders_with_payment_totals AS
      SELECT so.* …` with the new column on the base table FIRST?
- [ ] If the field is detail-only (UI shows it only on the SO detail page),
      did I append it on the base-table detail read at `/:docNo` instead?
- [ ] Did I apply the view migration BEFORE deploying the route code
      (migrate-before-deploy)?
- [ ] Did I re-verify with `pg_get_viewdef` against staging/prod after applying?
