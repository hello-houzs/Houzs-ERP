-- scm.settle_pi_paid_centi — the ONE write path for "move a purchase invoice's
-- paid_centi by this much", with the upper bound clamped by the DATABASE.
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--   Posting a SUPPLIER_PAYMENT voucher settles each linked purchase invoice
--   (backend/src/scm/routes/payment-vouchers.ts). The old shape was, in
--   application code:
--
--     read the PI            -> outstanding = total_centi - paid_centi
--     apply = min(want, outstanding)
--     read paid_centi again  -> write paid_centi + apply
--
--   The sum of allocations WITHIN one voucher is capped at the voucher total,
--   so one voucher alone is safe. TWO vouchers settling the SAME purchase
--   invoice are not. Both read the same paid_centi, both compute the same
--   `outstanding`, and both then apply their full share against a cap that was
--   already true when they read it and false by the time they wrote:
--
--     PI total 10,000 / paid 0
--     PV-A reads outstanding 10,000, PV-B reads outstanding 10,000
--     PV-A writes paid 10,000        PV-B writes paid 20,000
--
--   The invoice is now paid twice over. Note this is NOT a lost update — the
--   existing optimistic gate (`.eq('paid_centi', prev)`) makes sure BOTH
--   increments land, which is precisely the problem. The stale value is the
--   CAP, not the addend, so retrying harder makes it worse, not better.
--   Supplier reconciliation is where you find out, months later.
--
--   HOOKKA fixed this class in BUG-2026-05-21-001 by moving the arithmetic
--   into the database — `SET paidAmount = GREATEST(0, paidAmount - ?)` — so
--   concurrent settles serialise in Postgres instead of racing in Workers.
--   This is the mirror image: the bound being clamped is the UPPER one,
--   LEAST(total_centi, paid_centi + delta).
--
-- WHY A ROW LOCK AND NOT A BARE SINGLE-STATEMENT UPDATE
--   `UPDATE ... SET paid_centi = LEAST(total_centi, paid_centi + $1)` is a
--   single statement and would be race-free on its own. It cannot tell the
--   caller HOW MUCH it actually applied, because RETURNING sees only the new
--   row and Postgres before 18 has no OLD in RETURNING. That number is not
--   optional here: the caller writes it to pv_allocations.applied_centi, and a
--   later voucher cancel reverses exactly that figure. Recording the REQUESTED
--   amount after the database clamped it to something smaller would leave the
--   cancel un-applying money that was never applied — trading an over-payment
--   for an under-payment.
--
--   So the read and the write sit inside one function body (= one implicit
--   transaction) with SELECT ... FOR UPDATE taking the row lock. A concurrent
--   settle against the same PI blocks at that SELECT until this one commits,
--   then re-reads the committed row — so it sees the first voucher's payment
--   and clamps against the real remaining balance. Same serialisation as the
--   single-statement form, and it can report what it did. The sibling
--   scm.apply_customer_credit_to_si takes the same shape (it uses an advisory
--   lock; FOR UPDATE is stricter here because there is a single row to lock).
--
-- CLAMPING IS REPORTED, NOT SWALLOWED
--   applied_centi < the requested delta means an over-allocation was refused.
--   Silently absorbing that would replace one lie (paid_centi > total_centi)
--   with another (a voucher claiming to have settled more than it did), so the
--   function returns both numbers and the caller logs the difference. A clamp
--   is a real event a human needs to see, not a detail of the implementation.
--
-- NEGATIVE DELTAS (a voucher cancel reversing its settlement) keep the old
--   GREATEST(0, ...) floor and take NO upper clamp. A PI whose paid_centi is
--   already above total_centi from a legacy double-settle must still be able
--   to unwind fully; clamping a reversal down to total_centi would strand the
--   excess forever.
--
-- APPLICATION — STAGING FIRST (owner rule: data/schema ops go to staging before
--   prod). This is NOT in the auto-applied backend/src/db/migrations-pg/ tree
--   and is NOT run on deploy. Apply it by hand, staging then prod:
--     node scripts/scm-schema/apply-pi-settlement-atomic.mjs
--   settlePiPaidCenti detects the function's ABSENCE and falls back to the
--   legacy optimistic-loop path, so merging the code before this runs changes
--   nothing; the atomic path activates the moment the function exists.
--
-- ADDITIVE + IDEMPOTENT — CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION only, touches no table
-- data. Safe to re-run.
--
-- search_path pinned to scm so the unqualified table access never resolves to a
-- shadowing public.* table (the bug that broke the ported FIFO trigger).
