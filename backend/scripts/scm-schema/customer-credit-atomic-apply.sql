-- scm.apply_customer_credit_to_si — the ONE atomic write path for "apply a
-- customer's standing credit balance toward a new Sales Invoice".
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
--   applyCustomerCreditToSi (backend/src/scm/lib/customer-credits.ts) used to do
--   this as two SEPARATE PostgREST round trips — insert the credit payment row on
--   the SI, then insert the negative APPLIED_TO_SI ledger row — with no
--   transaction around them (there is no BEGIN/COMMIT in backend/src/scm; every
--   sb.from() is its own HTTP call). A crash / dropped connection BETWEEN the two
--   left the invoice paid from a credit that was never debited: the customer kept
--   the balance and could spend it a second time, with no error anywhere. It does
--   not report itself — you find it two months later at reconciliation.
--
--   A function body runs inside a single implicit transaction, so the two inserts
--   here either both commit or both roll back. This is the same atomicity pattern
--   the rest of scm already uses for multi-row writes (create_product_with_pricing,
--   upsert_customer_by_name_phone).
--
-- IDEMPOTENCY
--   A per-SI transaction-scoped advisory lock serialises concurrent applications,
--   and an existence check on the credit payment row makes a retry a no-op. Both
--   sit INSIDE the transaction that does the writes, so unlike the old read-guard
--   (a separate HTTP call that a transient blip could skip) they cannot be raced.
--
-- APPLICATION — STAGING FIRST (owner rule: data/schema ops go to staging before
--   prod). This is NOT in the auto-applied backend/src/db/migrations-pg/ tree and
--   is NOT run on deploy. Apply it by hand, staging then prod:
--     node scripts/scm-schema/apply-customer-credit-atomic.mjs
--   The calling code (applyCustomerCreditToSi) detects the function's ABSENCE and
--   falls back to the legacy two-write path, so merging the code before this runs
--   changes nothing; the atomic path activates the moment the function exists.
--
-- ADDITIVE + IDEMPOTENT — CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION only, touches no table data.
-- Safe to re-run.
--
-- search_path pinned to scm so the unqualified table writes never resolve to a
-- shadowing public.* table (the bug that broke the ported FIFO trigger).
