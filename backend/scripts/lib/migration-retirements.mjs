/**
 * Exact historical migration files that reached at least one live tracker and
 * were later removed from the tree. The SQL remains recoverable from Git by
 * blob id; keeping it outside the live migration tree prevents a fresh database
 * from replaying this obsolete (and, for 0023, destructive) chain.
 *
 * A retirement is an immutable-history record, not a wildcard. The runner may
 * accept a missing tracker row only when its complete filename appears here and
 * its stored checksum is either legacy NULL or this archived SHA-256. The same
 * filename reappearing in the live migration directory always hard-fails.
 *
 * HOW THIS LIST WAS DERIVED (no production dump required). A tracker row can
 * only exist for a filename that was present at some first-parent tip of main,
 * because deploy.yml runs pg-migrate.mjs on push to main and nowhere else. The
 * exact commands are in docs/MIGRATION-RETIREMENTS.md — walk
 * `git rev-list --first-parent origin/main`, `git ls-tree` the migrations-pg
 * directory at each commit, take the union of basenames, and subtract the
 * basenames present on origin/main today.
 *
 * On 2026-07-22 that yields exactly the 19 filenames below. Re-run it whenever
 * a migration is deleted. Files that only ever existed inside a feature branch
 * (0093_branding_2990.sql, 0093_restore_timestamp_defaults.sql) are correctly
 * excluded: they were renumbered before their branch's merge commit, so no
 * deploy ever saw them. The same command against origin/staging yields the
 * identical 19.
 *
 * The list being wrong is nevertheless not fatal: an unknown legacy row with no
 * checksum is adopted by the one-time genesis pass in migration-checksum.mjs
 * and printed in full, rather than blocking the deploy.
