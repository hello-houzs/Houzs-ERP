/**
 * One-shot backfill: give every ACTIVE Sales-department user a sales_reps row.
 *
 * WHY
 *   The Sales Team roster (sales_reps) is what the PMS "Sales Attending" picker
 *   and the SCM salesperson lists read. Historically a rep row was auto-created
 *   ONLY when a user's department CHANGED to Sales (syncSalesRepFromUser fired
 *   from the users PATCH hook). Users invited straight into a Sales department
 *   never triggered that path, so they had no rep and the picker showed
 *   "No Sales Persons found". The forward fix now syncs on invite/create too,
 *   but existing Sales staff created before that fix still have no rep — this
 *   script converges them.
 *
 * WHAT (mirrors syncSalesRepFromUser's create branch, one row at a time)
 *   For each ACTIVE user whose PRIMARY department name contains "sales"
 *   (case-insensitive) and who has NO sales_reps row (by user_id):
 *     1. allocate the next SR-NNN code (max existing SR-% code + 1)
 *     2. INSERT sales_reps (code, name, email, user_id, status='active')
 *     3. INSERT a sales_team_activity 'created' audit row
 *
 * SAFETY / STAGING-FIRST (owner rule: data ops run on STAGING first)
 *   - Prints the target DB host up front so you can confirm staging vs prod.
 *   - DRY-RUN by default: lists the exact rows it WOULD create and exits
 *     without writing. Pass --commit to actually insert.
 *   - Idempotent + additive: it only touches users with no existing rep, so
 *     re-running (on staging, then prod) never duplicates a rep and never
 *     unarchives or edits an existing one.
 *   - Scope guard: ACTIVE + department-contains-"sales" ONLY. Non-Sales users
 *     and disabled/invited users are never given a rep here.
 *
 * USAGE
 *   node backend/scripts/backfill-sales-reps.mjs            # dry-run (default)
 *   node backend/scripts/backfill-sales-reps.mjs --commit   # actually write
 *
 * Reads DATABASE_URL from .dev.vars (same convention as the other scripts).
 * Point .dev.vars at STAGING first, verify, then re-point at prod and re-run.
