/* PROD GUARD — this script TRUNCATEs every public table in the TARGET before
   refilling it. Its sibling load-d1-dump-to-pg.mjs carries the same guard, and
   it carries it because that script once wiped production (2026-06-17; see
   docs/prod-wipe-by-loader-coe.md). This one is the runbook's NEXT step and had
   no guard at all, which is the same accident waiting on a different line.

   Deliberately narrow: it refuses a PROD TARGET only. A prod SOURCE is a
   read-only copy-from and stays allowed — that is the normal way to seed a
   staging environment, and blocking it would push operators into editing the
   script, which is worse.

   Known limit, inherited from the sibling and worth naming rather than hiding:
   the project ref is HARDCODED and substring-matched, so this FAILS OPEN for
   any future production project. It stops the accident we have actually had;
   it is not a security control. */
