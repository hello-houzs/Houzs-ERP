// Backfill stored contact numbers to E.164, reversibly.
//
// Owner approved 2026-07-22 after the read-only audit reported 3788 values
// without a country code across 7 columns.
//
// WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A MIGRATION. pg-migrate runs on a push to main
// against production, and deploy-staging.yml runs on the same push against
// staging — so a migration file gives no "staging first", it gives "both at
// once". A workflow_dispatch script is the only shape where the staging run
// can be inspected before production is touched.
//
// SAFETY, in the order it matters:
//
//  1. DRY RUN IS THE DEFAULT. Writing needs --apply. A run with no flags
//     reports what it would do and changes nothing.
//  2. EVERY CHANGE IS RECORDED BEFORE IT IS MADE, in phone_normalisation_backup
//     (table, column, row id, old value, new value, run id). Reversing the
//     whole backfill is one UPDATE ... FROM that table. 3788 customer phone
//     numbers is not something to change without a way back.
//  3. THE SAME CONSERVATIVE GUARD THE API USES. canonicalizeSinglePhone
//     refuses anything that is not unambiguously ONE number — these are free
//     text columns and creditors.phone1 in particular has held "03-1234 5678 /
//     019-876 5432". Collapsing that into one string would destroy a supplier
//     contact, so a value we cannot canonicalise is LEFT ALONE and counted as
//     skipped, never guessed at.
//  4. NO ROW IS TOUCHED TWICE. Only rows whose canonical form actually differs
//     are updated, so re-running is a no-op and an interrupted run resumes
//     safely.
//  5. ONE TRANSACTION PER COLUMN. A failure rolls that column back whole
//     rather than leaving it half-converted.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/normalize-stored-phones.mjs             # dry run, changes nothing
//   node scripts/normalize-stored-phones.mjs --apply     # writes, with backup
//   node scripts/normalize-stored-phones.mjs --revert=<runId>

/* WHICH STORED VALUES MAY BE ASSUMED MALAYSIAN.
 *
 * canonicalizeSinglePhone is the API's rule, and for LIVE INPUT it is right: a
 * person typing into a form with a country picker set to Malaysia means
 * Malaysia. For a BACKFILL over rows nobody is looking at, the same rule is
 * dangerous, because normalizePhone treats any bare 8+ digit string as
 * Malaysian:
 *
 *     "61234567"  ->  "+6061234567"
 *
 * If that row was a Singapore landline (6123 4567) the migration has just
 * turned an obviously-broken number into a CONFIDENTLY WRONG one. Before, a
 * human looking at it would ask the customer. After, it looks like a normal
 * +60 number and nobody ever questions it — and the customer is unreachable.
 * That is strictly worse than leaving it alone.
 *
 * So the backfill converts only what is UNAMBIGUOUSLY Malaysian local:
 *   - leading trunk 0  ("0123456789")      — the ordinary local form
 *   - leading 60       ("60123456789")     — already says Malaysia
 *   - bare 9-10 digits starting with 1     — a mobile written without the 0,
 *                                            the shape the OCR rule produces
 * Everything else is REPORTED, not guessed at. A number a human must look at
 * is not a number a script should decide.

/* A value that is NOT Malaysian-local may still be perfectly good: the whole

 *     "880-1843395337" = +880 …        a complete Bangladeshi number
 *
 * Calling those "needs a human" wastes real phone calls on numbers that are
 * already right. So they are split:
 *
 *   RECOVERABLE — the digits start with a dial code we know, and what follows
 *     is a plausible national number (4-12 digits). Adding "+" is not a guess:
 *     a Malaysian mobile is 01X and a landline 0X, so a string opening with 65
 *     or 880 cannot be a Malaysian local number in the first place.
 *
 *   UNKNOWABLE — everything else. "NA", "#ERROR!", two numbers in one field, a
 *     length that matches nothing. These are the ones worth a phone call.
 *
 * Returns the E.164 form for a recoverable value, or null. */
