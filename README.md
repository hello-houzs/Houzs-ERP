# Houzs ERP

Internal operations platform for Houzs Century — AutoCount sync, procurement tracking, delivery planning, fleet + driver dispatch, service cases (ASSR), projects, and cross-module P&L. Replaces a legacy Google Sheets + Apps Script workflow with a single web app.

## Stack

| Layer | Tech | Lives in |
|-------|------|----------|
| Worker runtime | Cloudflare Workers + [Hono](https://hono.dev) | `backend/src/index.ts` |
| Data store | Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) | `backend/src/db/` |
| Blob store | Cloudflare R2 (proof-of-delivery photos, signatures, payment proofs) | R2 bucket `houzs-erp` |
| SPA | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind | `frontend/` |
| SPA hosting | Cloudflare Pages | `frontend/wrangler.toml` |
| Auth | Session-based (Bearer token), server-issued, role/permission gated | `backend/src/middleware/auth.ts` |
| Email | [Resend](https://resend.com) | `backend/src/services/email.ts` |
| Maps / geocoding | Google Geocoding (SO scan address) + Directions (trip route optimisation) | `backend/src/scm/routes/scan-so.ts` (geocode) · `backend/src/scm/lib/maps.ts` (routing, env-gated on `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`) |
| Upstream of record | AutoCount middleware (.NET) over HTTPS | `backend/src/services/autocount.ts` |
| E2E tests | Playwright | `e2e/` |

The Worker is the single HTTP entry point — the SPA calls it over CORS. AutoCount is called only from the Worker (never the browser) so credentials never leave the backend.

## Modules

| Module | Route | Perm | What it does |
|--------|-------|------|--------------|
| **Overview** | `/` | — | Daily briefing. Inbox (tasks, reviews, blockers, this-week), KPI ribbon, cross-module P&L calendar, pipeline snapshot. |
| **Sales Orders** | `/orders` | `sales_orders.read` | AutoCount sync target. Editable delivery fields that push back to AutoCount. Tabs: Orders, Balance (expiry collections), Overdue (auto-extension history), Sales P&L. |
| **Delivery Orders** | `/delivery-orders` | `delivery_orders.read` | Flat delivery-ready view of sales orders with logistics fields (lorry, driver, dates). Auto-hidden for dispatchers who have the richer Trips Queue (`hidePerm: trips.read.all`). |
| **Purchase Orders** | `/po` | `purchase_orders.read` | Unified procurement surface. Tabs: PO Documents (doc-level with per-status filter + line drill-down panel), Creditors (AutoCount mirror with PO aggregates), PO Cost P&L. PO amounts are read-only (upstream authority). |
| **Service Cases (ASSR)** | `/assr` | `service_cases.read` | After-sales workflow — stage pipeline, SLA tracking, satisfaction survey. Creditor auto-resolves from `case.item_code` → `stock_items.main_supplier` → `creditors.creditor_code` (no parallel supplier registry). Tabs: Cases, By Creditor, Quality Metrics, Service Cost P&L. |
| **Projects** | `/projects` | `projects.read` | Event-scoped lifecycle (exhibitions). Tabs: List, Calendar, Analytics, Profitability, Finance ledger, Checklist, Trips. Brand-scoped; payment proof stored in R2. |
| **Logistics** | `/logistics` | `trips.read.all` or `fleet.read` | Two-level nav. Primary tabs → Trips (Queue, Drafts, Live, Tracking, Events, History) and Fleet (Drivers, Helpers, Lorries, Compliance). Legacy `/trips` and `/fleet` redirect here preserving `?focus=…`. |
| **Team** | `/team` | `users.read` or `roles.read` | Tabs: Members (user accounts + pending invitations), Roles (grid of role cards with permission editor). Legacy `/roles` redirects to `/team?tab=roles`. |
| **Settings** | `/settings` | `settings.manage` | Tabs: Connection, Sync (filtered cron + full refresh), Email (Resend channel toggles), Activity Log (execution history across all jobs). |
| **Profile** | `/profile` | — | Password change, session, display name. |

### Driver sub-app

Driver-only users (holding `trips.read.own` without `trips.read.all` or `sales_orders.read`) are auto-redirected from `/` into the mobile shell at `/driver`. Pages: `DriverHome` (today's trip), `DriverTrip` (stop-by-stop POD capture), `DriverProfile` (clock-in, earnings, salary).

### Public (no login) surfaces

| Path | Token source | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `/track` and `/portal/case/:token` | `assr_cases.public_token` | Customer-facing case status page. |
| `/survey/:token` | `assr_surveys.token` | Post-close satisfaction survey emailed on case closure. |

```

Each sub-app (`backend/`, `frontend/`) owns its own `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `wrangler.toml`. The root `package.json` is a thin forwarder — every script shells into one of the sub-apps via `npm --prefix`.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# One-time: install deps in both sub-apps
npm run install:all

# Backend secrets (one-time per env)
cd backend
wrangler secret put AUTOCOUNT_API_KEY       # required
wrangler secret put DASHBOARD_API_KEY       # required — internal-ops API gate
wrangler secret put GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY     # route planner geocoder
wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY          # optional — email no-ops if unset
cd ..

# Apply schema + migrations to remote D1 (idempotent)
npm run db:migrate

# Dev servers (separate terminals)
npm run dev:backend     # wrangler dev on :8787
npm run dev:frontend    # vite on :5173
```

Create the first owner account with `wrangler d1 execute …` or the bootstrap route (see `backend/src/routes/auth.ts`). Subsequent users are created by invitation from `/team`.

---

## Scripts (root orchestrator)

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev:backend` | Runs `wrangler dev` inside `backend/` |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Runs `vite dev` inside `frontend/` |
| `npm run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` across both sub-apps |
| `npm run deploy:backend` | Deploys the Worker (`wrangler deploy`) |
| `npm run deploy:frontend` | Builds (`vite build`) + deploys the SPA to Cloudflare Pages |
| `npm run deploy:all` | Both, in order |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Applies every `backend/src/db/migrations/*.sql` to remote D1 (idempotent — tracks applied files in `d1_migrations`) |
| `npm run db:reset` | Disabled guard — prints why and exits 1 (it used to wipe the remote D1 cold-backup with no confirmation) |
| `npm run db:reset:remote:DANGER` | Re-applies `schema.sql` to the **remote** D1 (**destructive — prod data loss**). Explicit name on purpose |
| `npm run db:reset:local` | Same but against the local D1 sandbox |
| `npm run install:all` | `npm install` in `backend/` + `frontend/` |

---

## Cron schedule

Configured in `backend/wrangler.toml → [triggers] crons`. Dispatched by `backend/src/index.ts → scheduled(event, env, ctx)`.

| Schedule | Job | Entrypoint |
|----------|-----|------------|
| `*/5 * * * *` | Sales-order incremental sync (`/SalesOrder/getSince` + checkpoint) | `services/sync.ts → runPull` |
| `*/30 * * * *` | Purchase-order sync — `/PurchaseOrder/getAll` (docs) + `/PurchaseOrder/getOutstanding` (lines) | `services/po.ts → runPOPull` + `runPODocsPull` |
| `0 2 * * *` | Daily batch — overdue auto-extension, ASSR SLA escalation, project due-date reminder emails, `/Creditor/getAll` resync, stock-items refresh (re-resolves `assr_cases.creditor_code` when upstream `MainSupplier` changes) | `services/overdue.ts`, `services/assr.ts`, `services/projects.ts`, `services/creditors.ts`, `services/stockItems.ts` |

Everything else runs on-demand from user actions (Refresh buttons, panel interactions, manual `Sync All`).

Every scheduled run writes one row to `execution_logs` (`type`, `status`, `message`, `started_at`, `request_id`). The Activity Log tab in Settings is a paginated view over that table.

---

## AutoCount integration

AutoCount is treated as the **system of record** for anything procurement- or finance-related. The D1 tables `sales_orders`, `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_lines`, `purchase_order_docs_raw`, `creditors`, and `stock_items` are mirrors — refreshed on cron, read-mostly from the SPA.

| AutoCount endpoint | Used by | Refreshed |
|-|-|-|
| `/SalesOrder/getSince` | Orders incremental pull | `*/5` cron |
| `/SalesOrder/getAll` | Settings → Sync → "Full Refresh" | Manual |
| `/SalesOrder/update` | Orders delivery-field edits (push back) | On save |
| `/PurchaseOrder/getAll` | PO documents pull | `*/30` cron |
| `/PurchaseOrder/getOutstanding` | Outstanding lines (dashboard counts) | `*/30` cron |
| `/PurchaseOrder/getDetail` | PO side-panel drill-down (on-demand) | Click |
| `/Creditor/getAll` | Creditors mirror | Daily + manual |
| `/Creditor/getSingle` | On-demand creditor refresh | Click |
| `/StockItem/getSingle` | Service cases' `item_code → main_supplier` lookup (cached) | Daily + case save |

The Worker's client (`backend/src/services/autocount.ts`) prefixes every request with `AUTOCOUNT_API_URL` (`wrangler.toml [vars]`) and authenticates with `AUTOCOUNT_API_KEY` (secret). On failure it writes a `FAILED` row to `execution_logs` and returns a 500; the SPA surfaces the error via toast.

---

## Auth & permissions

- **Sessions** — `POST /api/auth/login` returns a `session_token`; the SPA stores it in `localStorage` and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Server resolves the token → `user_id` → role → permission set on every request (`backend/src/middleware/auth.ts`).
- **Roles** are rows in `roles`; permissions are stored as JSON arrays on the role. `is_system = 1` roles (Owner, Admin, Dispatcher, Driver, …) are immutable — the editor panel is read-only for them.
- **Wildcard** — the Owner role holds `*`, granting every permission. Other roles list explicit keys like `sales_orders.read`, `trips.manage`, `fleet.read`.
- **Route guards** — `App.tsx` wraps every protected route in a `<Guard perm="…">` (or `anyPerm={[…]}`) that redirects to `/` when the current user is missing the permission. This is defense-in-depth; the sidebar already hides entries the user can't use.
- **Driver-only routing** — a user who can read trips (`trips.read.own`) but no office surfaces (`sales_orders.read`, `delivery_orders.read`) is auto-bounced to `/driver` at the root level (see `isDriverOnly` in `App.tsx`).
- **Public surfaces** (`/track`, `/survey/:token`) — gated by opaque row-scoped tokens in the DB, not session auth. Middleware in `backend/src/middleware/caseTrack.ts`.

---

## Configuration

### `backend/wrangler.toml`

```toml
[vars]
AUTOCOUNT_API_URL = "https://it-houzs.dev/"
PUBLIC_APP_URL    = "https://erp.houzscentury.com"   # canonical domain; used to build email links
EMAIL_FROM        = "Houzs ERP <no-reply@mail.it-houzs.dev>"

[[d1_databases]]
binding      = "DB"
database_name = "autocount-sync"

[[r2_buckets]]
binding     = "POD_BUCKET"
bucket_name = "houzs-erp"
```

### Required secrets (`wrangler secret put`)

| Secret | Who uses it | What happens if unset |
|-|-|-|
| `AUTOCOUNT_API_KEY` | Every AutoCount call | Syncs fail, `execution_logs` records `FAILED` |
| `DASHBOARD_API_KEY` | Internal ops routes | Requests 401 |
| `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | Route planner geocoder | Planner falls back to "unknown", no map render |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | Transactional email | Email service silently no-ops (intentional — deploy never breaks) |

### `frontend/.env.production`

```
VITE_API_URL=https://autocount-sync-api.<account>.workers.dev
```

The SPA prepends this to every API call. In dev the fallback is `http://localhost:8787`.

---

## Data model highlights

- **`execution_logs`** — every sync / cron / manual job writes a row. Activity Log tab is a paginated view.
- **`d1_migrations`** — tracks which `0NN_*.sql` files have been applied; `npm run db:migrate` skips already-applied files.
- **`users`, `roles`, `user_roles`** — auth. System roles are seeded in `001_auth.sql`.
- **`sales_orders`, `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_lines`, `purchase_order_docs_raw`** — AutoCount mirrors. `purchase_order_docs_raw` holds the untransformed header JSON so the side panel can surface every AutoCount field without another API call.
- **`creditors`, `stock_items`** — AutoCount mirrors (Phase 5). `assr_cases.creditor_code` is populated from `stock_items.main_supplier` at save time and re-reconciled every daily cron.
- **`assr_cases`** — service case with stage pipeline (`stage` column), SLA tracking (`sla_deadline`, `sla_breached_at`), and customer-facing `public_token`.
- **`projects`** — event-scoped, brand-scoped. `payment_proof_r2_key` points at R2. No FK to contractors/suppliers (dropped in migration 036).
- **`trips`, `trip_stops`, `trip_events`, `trip_drivers`** — dispatch graph. `trip_events` is append-only (clock-ins, status changes, notes).
- **`finance_ledger`** — double-entry-ish project cost tracking feeding the Projects P&L.

All financial rollups (Sales P&L, PO Cost P&L, Service Cost P&L, Projects P&L, Overview) run against SQLite views or ad-hoc queries — no pre-computed aggregates, since D1 handles the data volumes comfortably.

---

## Architecture notes

- **Single Worker, many routes** — each route file in `backend/src/routes/*.ts` mounts onto the root Hono app at a specific prefix (e.g. `app.route("/api/orders", orders)`). The auth middleware runs before every `/api/*` route.
- **Scheduled handler** wraps each cron branch in `ctx.waitUntil(...)` with an outer try/catch so one job's failure doesn't kill the rest. Each branch owns its own `execution_logs` row.
- **Server-side sort** — `DataTable` accepts a `serverSort` prop; `useServerSort` manages state. Paginated endpoints read `sort_by` and `sort_dir` query params, validate against a backend `SORT_MAP` allow-list, and apply a tiebreaker on `id` so pagination is stable across page boundaries.
- **Tab + title pattern** — every multi-view page renders `<TabStrip>` first, then a `<PageHeader>` whose title/description come from a `TAB_HEADER` map keyed by the active tab. Action buttons (e.g. "Invite Member" on Members tab, "New Role" on Roles tab) are driven by the same map and sit in `PageHeader.actions`.
- **PWA** — service worker caches the app shell (HTML, JS, CSS, icons, logo, manifest) cache-first; API calls bypass the worker and go network-first over CORS to the Worker. Driver-only users get an offline-tolerant POD capture flow.
- **Global search** (⌘K / `/`) — `GET /api/search?q=…` fans out to 8 sources (orders, POs, creditors, cases, projects, trips, stock items, users) in parallel, merges, and deep-links into the right module with the right tab.

---

## Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy:all              # frontend build + deploy, then worker deploy
npm run deploy:backend          # worker only
npm run deploy:frontend         # SPA only
```

The Pages deploy picks up the SPA build from `frontend/dist/` (configured in `frontend/wrangler.toml` → `pages_build_output_dir`). DNS / custom domains are managed in the Cloudflare dashboard and not in this repo.

Migrations must be applied before any deploy that depends on new schema. The canonical order is:

```bash
npm run db:migrate          # apply any new migrations first
npm run deploy:all          # then ship the code
```

---

## Testing

Playwright specs in `e2e/specs/`. Parametrised by `BASE_URL` — point at localhost for dev, the staging Pages URL for PR previews, or prod as a smoke test.

```bash
cd e2e
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
npm test                                     # hits BASE_URL (default localhost)
npm test -- --base-url=https://…             # override
```

No backend/frontend unit tests exist yet — Vitest is the planned pick when a service grows complex enough to warrant them.

---

## Migrations discipline

- Every schema change goes through a new numbered file in `backend/src/db/migrations/`.
- Files are applied in numeric order by `npm run db:migrate`; the script tracks applied files in the `d1_migrations` table and skips them on re-run.
- Don't edit a migration after it's been applied to prod. Write a new one.
- SQLite can't `DROP COLUMN` when the column is referenced by an index or a foreign key. Pattern: `DROP INDEX` first, or rebuild the table (see `036_drop_legacy_suppliers.sql` for the projects-table rebuild example).
- Use `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` liberally — it keeps the migration idempotent against re-runs on half-applied state.

---

## Getting help

- `/help` surface inside the app — in-app tour + keyboard shortcuts (⌘K / `/` for search).
- `docs/` holds architecture PDFs and module-specific guides. Check there first when something is non-obvious.
- Cloudflare dashboard → Workers → `autocount-sync-api` → Logs for live request traces.
- `execution_logs` table in D1 for cron / sync history (also exposed in Settings → Activity Log).
