# Houzs ERP — Database Reference

Every table in the Houzs database, grouped by module. Built so you can find
any table fast: Ctrl+F a table name, a module name, or a keyword (e.g.
"commission", "lorry", "checklist").

- **Engine:** migrating D1 (SQLite) -> Supabase Postgres (Singapore). See
  `MIGRATION-D1-TO-SUPABASE.md` for status. Migration coverage is marked per
  module below.
- **Total:** ~107 tables across 12 modules.
- **Naming:** snake_case, module-prefixed (`assr_*`, `project_*`, `sales_*`,
  `lorry_*`, `trip_*`, `assr_*`). Lookup tables hold dropdown/enum rows.
  `*_activity` tables are append-only audit/chat trails. `*_new` / `*_rebuild`
  are transitional copies left by a migration — not live, safe to ignore.

How this maps to a standard ERP (ERPNext/Odoo) is noted on each module so the
structure is familiar to any ERP developer.

## 10. Gamification & Engagement
No standard ERP equivalent. Houzs Points, streaks, awards store, idea/suggestion
boards. Points balances on `users` are caches derived from `point_transactions`.

tables.

---

## Conventions cheat-sheet

- **Prefix = module.** `assr_*` after-sales, `project_*` PMS, `sales_*` sales,
  `lorry_*`/`trip_*` fleet, `customer_*`/`supplier_*` portals.
- **Lookup tables** (`*_categories`, `*_priorities`, `*_positions`, `*_tiers`,
  `*_event_types`, `*_resolution_methods`) hold dropdown/enum rows — small,
  rarely change, often seeded in migrations.
- **`*_activity`** = append-only audit + chat trail.
- **`*_tokens`** = one-shot public links (no login).
- **Ledgers** (`point_transactions`, `project_finance_lines`) are append-only;
  any cached balance is derived from them.
- **Transitional / dead:** `projects_new`, `projects_rebuild`, `assr_cases_new`
  came from table-rebuild migrations. The live ASSR table is **`assr_cases`**
  (`assr_cases_new` was renamed to it in mig 074); the `projects_*` copies are inert.

## Migration status (D1 -> Supabase)

- 57 tables already in Supabase (the Drizzle-reflected set in `schema.pg.ts`).
- ~50 tables still D1-only (raw-SQL tables, mostly `assr_*`, portal, fleet,
  lookups). They need their DDL ported before cutover — tracked in
  `MIGRATION-D1-TO-SUPABASE.md`.
- Data not yet copied: requires a `wrangler d1 export autocount-sync` from the
  Cloudflare account that owns the D1 database.
