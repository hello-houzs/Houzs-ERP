// Bundle-size budget gate.
//
// Runs after `vite build` (see ci.yml). Measures the production JS in
// dist/assets and fails CI when THIS CHANGE makes the bundle materially
// heavier, so a stray `import` of a heavy library into the always-loaded path —
// the thing that actually makes first paint slow — is caught in review instead
// of in production.
//
// HOW IT DECIDES (changed 2026-07-22 — read this before touching a number)
//
// Every metric is compared against a BASELINE measured on the merge base, built
// by the same toolchain in the same CI run (see the "bundle baseline" step in
// .github/workflows/ci.yml). The verdict is the DELTA. Absolute ceilings are
// kept, but demoted: a ceiling can only fail the PR that actually crosses it,
// and when main is already over, the report says so in those words and the PR
// passes. The rules, and the four false failures that forced this, are written
// out in scripts/lib/bundle-verdict.mjs — that file is the specification.
//
// Short version of why: on a `pull_request` event GitHub builds the MERGE with
// main, so every PR inherits main's bundle. An absolute ceiling therefore fails
// whichever PR happens to run after main spends the budget. On 2026-07-21 that
// was #873 — a DOCS-ONLY PR touching `docs/mockups/pdf/*` and zero source files
// — failing `total JS (gzip) 1770.1 KB / 1770.0 KB`, over by 0.1 KB it did not
// and could not have added.
//
// Usage:
//   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs                      # ceilings only
//   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs --json out.json      # measure, write, exit 0
//   node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs --baseline base.json # delta vs merge base
//
// Run locally: `npm run build && node scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Measurement history (kept: the diff is the audit trail)
//
//   baseline 2026-06-13 (after route code-splitting):
//     initial JS gzip  ~84.6 KB  (index 30.9 + react-vendor 53.8)
//     total   JS gzip  ~370  KB
//     largest chunk    ~200  KB raw (Projects)
//
//   2026-06-25 (after the SCM 2990 cutover landed in full):
//     initial JS gzip ~115.5 KB  (index 38.3 + react-vendor 77.3)
//   react-vendor is pure framework — react + react-dom + react-router +
//   @tanstack/react-query — every byte of which is eager by necessity
//   (the QueryClientProvider/Router wrap the whole app). index is the app
//   shell + the route table: the cutover registered ~50 new lazy routes,
//   and while each PAGE is code-split, its lazy() declaration + <Route>
//   live in the always-loaded shell.
//
//   2026-06-30 (lucide tree-shake fix + accumulated drift):
//     initial JS gzip ~118.8 KB  (index 41.5 + react-vendor 77.3)
//     total   JS gzip ~1348 KB
//     largest chunk    ~430 KB raw (xlsx)
//   The lucide-react chunk dropped from ~777 KB raw → ~82 KB after replacing
//   `import * as Lucide` + `lucide-react/dynamicIconImports` in Categories.tsx
//   with named imports + a static ICON_MAP (Rollup can now tree-shake the rest
//   of the icon set out). That removed ~115 KB gzip from total JS.
//
//   2026-07-16 (route prefetch) — read this as a warning about the line above:
//     initial JS gzip ~130.0 KB  (main measured 129.7 on PR #625)
//   The 2026-06-30 bump left ~11 KB of headroom over the 118.8 measured that
//   day. It was GONE: main sat at 129.7 — 99.8% — and nobody bumped or recorded
//   a number on the way up, so the gate had quietly become a tripwire that the
//   next commit, any commit, was going to hit. This one did, at +0.3 KB.
//
//   2026-07-18 (measure what the browser fetches):
//     initial JS gzip ~155 KB, measured from dist/index.html
//   This gate had never counted `lucide` or `vendor`, both of which index.html
//   modulepreloads, so the real eager payload on that same commit was ~269 KB
//   gzip — roughly double what the gate reported PASS on. `vendor` was ~117 KB
//   of it and was almost entirely jspdf's dependency tree, eager only because
//   manualChunks co-located it with @remix-run/router; see vite.config.ts.
//   Fixing the chunking dropped the true figure to ~155 KB and the initial set
//   now comes from the emitted HTML, so this class of drift cannot recur
//   silently.
//
//   2026-07-19: total 1748.9 -> 1753.4 (Fulfillment Costing mobile screen);
//   ceiling 1750 -> 1770, then the same day 1770 -> 1800 after TWO unrelated
//   branches tripped the spent budget within hours of each other.
//
//   2026-07-20: main sat exactly at 1770 and a cosmetic page-titles PR was the
//   one that failed; the already-documented 1800 was finally applied.
//
//   2026-07-21: total on main reached ~1770.0 and docs-only PR #873 failed at
//   1770.1. Four false failures in eight days, four bumps, zero of them the
//   cause. The fifth bump is not the fix — the comparison is.

  // the old commit was ~269 KB and removing jspdf's tree from the eager path
  // cut it to ~155). Keep tight: a real regression here is a first-paint cost.
  INITIAL_JS_GZIP: 165 * KB,

  // A soft guard against unbounded total growth, not a first-paint cost. Left
  // at 1800 deliberately — main is at ~99% of it and RAISING IT AGAIN IS NOT
  // THE FIX. From 2026-07-22 the growth allowance below is what fails a PR, and
  // this number's remaining job is to keep printing OVER-ON-MAIN on every run
  // until someone makes a deliberate decision about the lazy tail on main.
  //
  // WHEN IT DOES GET DECIDED: check INITIAL_JS_GZIP first (if that is healthy,
  // the lazy tail is still lazy and growth here is users paying only for pages
  // they open), then look for a formerly-lazy module that has become eagerly
  // reachable — that is the failure mode this budget exists to catch, and the
  // vite.config manualChunks comment documents the last time it happened.
  TOTAL_JS_GZIP: 1800 * KB,
  // Any single chunk, raw. A route blowing past this should be split. Sized to
  // fit the heaviest vendored lib — xlsx (~430 KB raw), pulled out of the eager
  // `vendor` chunk and loaded only on export.

//   * a new lazy route page      +4 to +8 KB gzip on total, ~+0.1 KB on initial
//   * a shared hook + ~30 imports  +2.8 KB gzip on total  (perf/frontend-audit)
//   * a stray heavy library on the eager path
//                                 +16 KB (lucide) to +117 KB (jspdf tree) gzip
// So: initial +8 KB is roughly 80x a legitimate route registration and half the
// smallest real regression on record — a stray import cannot hide under it.
// Total +60 KB is ~8 new pages in one PR, or one vendored library, which is
// exactly the size of change that should have to say so out loud.
