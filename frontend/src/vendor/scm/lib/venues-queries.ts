// Vendored SLICE of apps/backend/src/lib/venues-queries.ts — the SO list/detail
// + SO Maintenance venue reads/CRUD.
//
// ── HOUZS RE-SOURCING (2026-06-21) ──────────────────────────────────────────
// Venues are maintained CENTRALLY in Houzs's Project Maintenance / PMS, not in
// the SCM. The old `/api/scm/venues` route never existed in the cutover (it
// 404'd), so these hooks now source from the Houzs-native Project Maintenance
// API: GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/projects/venues.
//
// That endpoint lives OUTSIDE the /api/scm mount, so `authedFetch` (which
// prepends /api/scm) cannot reach it. We use the Houzs-native `api` client
// (../../../api/client) which carries the same bearer token but targets the
// Worker root.
//
// Shape adaptation — the projects VenueRow is { id:number, name, state, notes,
// active } and the GET only returns active venues. We map it onto the SCM
// `VenueRow` contract the SO/CO consumers already expect:
//   • id    → String(id)   — the SO pickers match `venue.id === staff.venueId`
//                            with `===`, and staff.venueId is a STRING. Keeping
//                            id a string preserves that comparison.
//   • notes → address      — projects venues have no `address`; `notes` is the
//                            nearest free-text column (read-only display only).
//   • state                — carried through so the SO venue picker can read it.
//   • active → true        — the projects GET only returns active rows.
