// so-header-diff — PURE dirty-field diff for the SO HEADER patch.
// NO React, no I/O. Desktop SalesOrderDetail and mobile MobileNewSO both feed
// their own outgoing payload + the payload AS SEEDED into diffHeaderPayload, so
// "what did the operator actually change" is decided ONCE.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS — the backend PATCH has ALWAYS been sparse:
//   scm/routes/mfg-sales-orders.ts — `if (body[from] === undefined) continue;`
// A key the client omits is a column the server does not touch. Both clients
// defeated that by rebuilding all ~21 header fields on every save, so every
// save wrote every column. Two consequences, and the second needs no second
// user:
//   1. CONCURRENT — the last save clobbered 21 columns, reverting fields the
//      saver never looked at.
//   2. SINGLE-USER — the header PATCH's master-follower cascade is keyed on
//      PRESENCE, not change (`if (body['customerDeliveryDate'] !== undefined)`),
//      and it rewrites EVERY line's line_delivery_date and clears
//      line_delivery_date_overridden. An always-sent customerDeliveryDate fired
//      it on every save, so editing only the note wiped every per-line delivery
//      date override. Sending only the dirty fields restores the guard's intent:
//      the cascade fires when the header date CHANGED, and only then.
//
// The line path already worked this way (originalDraftsRef + lineCommitSig in
// SalesOrderDetail) — its comment states this same argument in the mirror
// direction ("an edit to the header / customer / demographics alone must NOT
// touch the lines"). This is the inverse, which was never applied.

 * Return ONLY the entries of `next` that differ from `original`.
 *
 * `original` MUST be the payload the form was SEEDED from (i.e. built from the
 * server's header row through the SAME builder as `next`), never the initial
 * render state and never a live-refetching header. Both sides passing through
 * one builder is what stops normalisation from false-positiving: an untouched
 * field produces byte-identical values on both sides, so only a genuine edit
 * survives the diff (the line path's lineCommitSig relies on exactly this).
 *
 * The three empty-ish values are THREE DIFFERENT FACTS and are treated as such:
 *   - `undefined` in `next` -> SKIP. The caller means "don't touch this column",
 *     which is what the server's `body[from] === undefined` guard already reads,
 *     and what JSON.stringify already did by dropping the key. Unchanged.
 *   - `null` in `next`      -> a real edit when the stored value is non-empty.
 *     SENT, so the clear persists as NULL.
 *   - `''` in `next`        -> likewise SENT when the stored value is non-empty.
 * Only when BOTH sides are empty do they collapse, which drops "clear an
 * already-empty field" (a no-op write) while never dropping "clear a field that
 * had a value".
 *
 * Values are SELECTED, never rewritten: whatever the caller's builder decided a
 * field's on-the-wire value should be is exactly what ships, so a field that IS
 * dirty behaves precisely as it does today.
