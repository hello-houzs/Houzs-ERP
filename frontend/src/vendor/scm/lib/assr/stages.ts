// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// assr/stages — the CANONICAL service-case (ASSR) stage pipeline + the
// resolution-routing rule. NO React, no query client, no I/O.
//
// This is the single source of truth for the 7-stage workflow and, crucially,
// for the ONE rule that used to drift between desktop and mobile: when a case
// is resolved in-house (own field service / return visit) the two
// supplier-only stages — Supplier Pickup and Item Ready — drop out of the
// pipeline entirely. Desktop enforced this via getActiveStages; mobile did
// not, so internal-resolution cases on mobile mis-routed INTO those stages and
// showed the wrong progress denominator. Both surfaces now share this file.
//
// Stage vocabulary since mig 0110 (Item Pickup retired; the customer-side
// collection lives inside the Supplier stage) / mig 0105 (Pending Inspection
// folded into Verification).
