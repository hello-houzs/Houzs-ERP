// so-amendment-line-diff — PURE display logic for the LINE half of an SO
// amendment. NO React, no I/O. The approver's job card (AmendmentDetailV2), the
// desktop SO-detail diff modal and the mobile "View changes" sheet all render
// the same rows, so "is this line actually a change, and WHICH field moved"
// lives ONCE — the header half's mirror of so-amendment-header.ts.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (Owner 2026-07-16): "完全看不出有什麼變動申請？" — an amendment
// whose real request was a HEADER change rendered four SPEC CHANGE cards whose
// Was and Requesting columns were character-for-character identical, above a
// header that claimed "4 changes". The approver could not tell what was being
// asked, and the count was a lie.
//
// A recorded line can be delta-free for two reasons, both real in prod data:
//   * the create-time builder's dirtiness test (lineCommitSig) was WIDER than
//     the payload an amendment line can carry, so a line dirty only in
//     lineDeliveryDate — which the header Delivery Date cascade rewrites on
//     EVERY non-overridden line — was recorded with new_* == old_*.
//   * draftFromItem canonicalises variants (POS sofa aliases) while the
//     oldSnapshot records the RAW item.variants, so a POS-created line could
//     record a "changed" variant blob that renders identically.
// The builders no longer record either (see buildAmendmentLines on both
// platforms), but rows created before that fix are already in the DB — this
// module is what stops them lying to the approver.
//
// The comparison is deliberately made on the RENDERED values, not the raw
// blobs: the surfaces show item code / qty / unit price / variant SUMMARY, and
// the summary is alias-aware (buildVariantSummary) while the raw variants are
// not. Comparing raw JSON would call a canonicalised-but-identical POS line a
// change — exactly the lie this closes. The rule is simply: if what the
// approver reads on the left equals what they read on the right, it is not a
// change. No real request can be hidden by it — these four fields are the ONLY
// things an amendment line carries.

   its non-bedframe branch and simply never read divanHeight / gap / totalHeight,

   line's REAL group and did read them. The two sides were being formatted by two
   different rules and the difference read as data loss.
