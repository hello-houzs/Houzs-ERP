/* so-amendment-history — the ONE logic layer that turns the SO audit trail into
   an amendment's approve / reject decision record (owner ask 2026-07-18: "整个 SO
   Amendment 是不是都可以看到它的 approve 记录和 reject 记录" — the approve AND reject
   history, WHO, WHEN, and the reason, on both desktop and mobile).

   WHY this exists rather than reading the amendment's own *_by / *_at columns:
   the reject gate stores NO timestamp/actor column at all — it only flips status
   to REJECTED (backend so-amendments.ts). The reason, actor and time of a
   rejection survive ONLY in mfg_so_audit_log (action AMENDMENT_REJECTED,
   note = reason). So the column-derived timeline could never show a rejection.
   The audit log is the honest, complete source: every gate writes one
   AMENDMENT_* row through recordSoAudit. Both surfaces read it via the SAME
   vendored useSalesOrderAuditLog hook and this shared builder.

   Isolation to ONE amendment: the audit log is keyed by so_doc_no, and an SO can
   carry several amendments over its life (a rejected one, then a fresh one). The
   backend's one-open partial-unique index means only one amendment is in flight
   at a time, so a NEW amendment is always raised AFTER the prior one reached a
   terminal decision. Therefore every AMENDMENT_* row at created_at >= this
   amendment's created_at belongs to THIS amendment's lifecycle; earlier rows
   belong to earlier amendments. That time floor is the clean boundary. */
