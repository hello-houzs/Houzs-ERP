// line-identity — the ONE home for "how a document line NAMES itself".
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (read before adding a surface that renders a line):
// the owner reported the SAME defect FOUR times over as many weeks — a line
// showing its description in bold AND repeating the item CODE on a muted second
// line, the same identity twice in one row:
//
//     AKEMI IMMORTAL MATTRESS (152X190X36CM)     <- description
//     AKEMI IMMORTAL MATT (Q)                    <- the code. redundant.
//
//   #616  SO quick-view drawer          fixed on the drawer only
//   #626  mobile SKU picker             fixed on the picker only
//   #623  ASSR list + picker            fixed on those two only
//   #647  SO detail LINE ITEMS          fixed on that table only
//
// Each fix landed on the ONE screen that had been screenshotted, so the rule
// lived in four hand-copied comments and nowhere a fifth surface could find it.
// FIXING THE SCREEN HE POINTS AT IS WHAT CAUSED THE FOURTH REPORT. This module
// is the same move `finance-keys.ts` made on the backend ("the list used to be
// re-declared per route, and every copy drifted") and `fmtMoneyCenti` made on
// the frontend (#647 — one shape, 16 page-local copies).
//
// THE RULE (owner, standing, restated many times — precedent quote, Commander
// 2026-05-27: "picker rows show description only — one scannable line per SKU.
// The code still binds on click"):
//   On a surface that shows a line's DESCRIPTION, the description shows ONCE and
//   the redundant item CODE is NOT displayed.
// It is a DISPLAY rule, not a data rule. The code still BINDS everywhere it
// binds today — sort, search, export, click-through, payload. Nothing in this
// module touches a getValue / searchValue / sortValue / key / aria-label.
//
// HOW THIS FILE ENFORCES THE RULE BY DEFAULT RATHER THAN BY MEMORY:
// `LineIdentity` has NO `code` field. A caller that renders `primary` and
// `secondary` CANNOT put the code on a second line, because the helper never
// hands the code back as something separately renderable — it is an INPUT that
// only ever surfaces as the fallback inside `primary`. A new surface gets the
// rule by calling the helper, not by remembering a comment.
//
// WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES **NOT** COVER (each is a LEAVE, and each
// one is a way a blind sweep would DESTROY information):
//  - A code in its OWN table COLUMN beside a separate Description column. That
//    is not a duplicated line, it is a scannable field the owner sorts and
//    exports on (SalesOrderDetailListing, DeliveryPlanning, the Convert-From
//    pickers). Do not route those through here.
//  - A row with NO description available. The code is then the only identifier
//    and dropping it makes the row unidentifiable — which is why `primary`
//    falls back to the code rather than going blank (the #647 behaviour).
//  - The VARIANT. This is the trap #647 caught and the most important line in
//    this file. On `DIVAN ONLY BEDFRAME (5FT)` the second line reads
//    `DIVAN ONLY-(Q) · PC151-14 / DIVAN 8" + LEG 8"`. The CODE is redundant; the
//    VARIANT (`PC151-14 / DIVAN 8" + LEG 8"`) appears NOWHERE ELSE on that row,
//    so dropping the whole second line deletes information rather than a
//    duplicate. `secondary` keeps the variant and drops only the code.
//  - Non-sales vocabularies where the code is the PRIMARY identifier rather than
//    an echo — an ASSR case no, a supplier / creditor code, a project code, a
//    product MODEL code. Every owner precedent is sales-side. Do not force this
//    onto a surface where the code is what the row IS.
//
// Pure — no I/O, no DOM, no React (this directory is framework-free .ts by
// convention, vendored from 2990). Desktop and mobile are ONE logic layer
// (standing owner rule), so both consume this same function; a rule that lands
// on desktop only is tomorrow's fifth report.
