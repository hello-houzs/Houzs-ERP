/* The client half of the admin "send reset link" invariant.
 *
 * The backend no longer returns the reset token (pinned in
 * backend/tests/adminResetLink.test.ts). This pins the other end: neither admin
 * screen may put a reset link in the admin's hands. Both used to — on every
 * SUCCESSFUL send, not merely as an email-is-down fallback — which meant any
 * holder of `users.manage` walked away with a working one-hour credential for
 * the account they had just "helped", including accounts more privileged than
 * their own. The audit row said a reset was issued; it could not say who used it.
 *
 * Kept as a source test for the same reason as its backend twin: the regression
 * is a two-line convenience that reads as helpful in review, so it needs a red
 * test rather than a comment. Team.tsx legitimately copies INVITE links, so the
 * assertions are scoped to a window around the reset call rather than the file.
 *
 * import.meta.glob (not fs) so this stays runnable under any vitest environment
 * the suite is configured with, and so a path that stops resolving fails loudly
 * on the emptiness assertions below instead of silently passing on "".
