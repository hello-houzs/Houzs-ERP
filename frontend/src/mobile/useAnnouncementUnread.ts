// It used to count the SYSTEM scope only (scan / service-case per-user
// notices), so a human-written broadcast — the thing the office actually
// publishes — contributed NOTHING: no pop-up, no dot, no way to learn it
// existed short of walking into Profile > Announcements (owner 2026-07-21).
// It now counts BOTH halves of the feed; both are things the user has not read.
//
// Two scoped reads rather than one unscoped read, because these are the SAME
// two queries the Announcements screen and the pop-up already run — the badge
// therefore adds no network of its own. Acking anywhere invalidates the whole
// feed-key namespace, so the badge drops immediately instead of after a poll.
