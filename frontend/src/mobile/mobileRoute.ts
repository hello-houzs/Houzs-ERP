/** Resolves the browser URL to a mobile destination.
 *
 *  WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The mobile shell (MobileApp) is a `useState` screen
 *  machine, not a router: it mounts INSTEAD of the desktop `<Routes>` tree
 *  (auth/AuthScreens.tsx AuthGate) and, until this file, never read
 *  `window.location.pathname` at all. Its screen state simply initialised to
 *  the first bottom tab. So EVERY URL — /scm/purchase-orders,
 *  /scm/purchase-invoices, /scm/hr/settings, a typo, anything — rendered the
 *  Sales Orders list and fired the Sales Orders queries, with the page titled
 *  "Sales Orders". Not an error, not a blank: a DIFFERENT DOCUMENT TYPE shown
 *  confidently under another document's URL. The desktop tree's own
 *  `<Route path="*" element={<Forbidden kind="not-found" />} />` (App.tsx) was
 *  never reached, because the desktop tree never mounts on a phone.
 *
 *  This resolver answers one question and holds no opinions about permissions:
 *  "does this path name a destination the mobile app can open, and which one".
 *  The CALLER applies the gate, by passing only the destinations the signed-in
 *  user is actually allowed to see (MobileApp already computes exactly that
 *  list for its menu). A path that names a real destination the user may not
 *  open must resolve to `locked`, never to `home` — landing someone on the
 *  Orders list because they lack access is the same lie in a smaller form.
