// Mobile OCR "Scan" screen — capture phone photos of a handwritten sales
// slip and POST them to /scan-so/enqueue: the upload returns in seconds with a
// job id and the OCR + DRAFT SO create finish SERVER-SIDE inside the Worker's
// waitUntil (owner 2026-07-04: "upload 了直接关掉 App,后台自己慢慢跑"). The
// operator does NOT review the form first — each order lands in Orders as a
// DRAFT when its job finishes, and closing the app no longer kills anything.
//
// The legacy on-screen flow (await /scan-so/extract per payment slip, then
// createDraftFromPrefill client-side) is kept verbatim as submitLegacy — the
// automatic fallback when /enqueue 404s (a worker without the route yet).
// createDraftFromPrefill sends asDraft: true (status DRAFT — the backend
// drafts ONLY on that explicit flag, never on empty dates alone).
//
// SURVIVES NAVIGATION — the create fetch is FIRED (not awaited before we leave):
// once it's in flight it completes even if the operator has navigated away or
// pressed Cancel in-app, so a draft still lands in Orders. (One limitation: a
// full app/tab CLOSE mid-flight can still drop an in-flight create — only a
// server-side job would fully survive that. See the report note.)
//
// MULTIPLE ORDERS PER SESSION — the operator often has a stack of slips. This
// screen models the session as an ARRAY of orders, each its own front slip +
// payment-slip array: OrderDraft = { front, payShots[] }. "+ Add order" queues
// another order; each order is captured and grouped under its own "Order N"
// header. The "each payment slip = one payment" rule stays PER ORDER.
//
// MULTIPLE PAYMENT SLIPS (per order) — an order can take 2-3 payments (deposit +
// balances), and each physical slip / card-terminal receipt is ONE payment. The
// front slip stays single per order; the payment slip is an ARRAY (add-more +
// per-slip remove). Because the current /scan-so/extract contract reads exactly
// ONE order slip + ONE payment receipt into a SINGLE payment, we OCR each
// payment slip in its OWN /extract call (that order's front slip attached to
// every call so the order fields are read once and each call's single payment is
// the k-th slip's payment). We then merge: the FIRST call supplies the order +
// payment #1, calls 2..N each supply one more payment. This yields N payments
// per N slips end-to-end WITHOUT any backend change — each call uses the existing
// 1-slip + 1-receipt contract verbatim. (See the report note for the alternative
// single-call array contract if the backend later grows a paymentFiles[]/
// payments[] mode.)
//
// DELETE — every uploaded thumbnail (front + payment, in every order) carries a
// small "×" remove control so a wrong capture can be dropped before submitting.
//
// MULTI-ORDER — because we now create the draft ourselves (no single-prefill
// handoff limit), EVERY queued order becomes its own DRAFT: we OCR each order
// and fire one createDraftFromPrefill per order. N orders → N drafts in Orders.
//
// Camera capture uses a hidden <input type="file" accept="image/*"> per slot —
// the standard PWA pattern. The FRONT slip input keeps capture="environment"
// (one slip, straight to the rear camera); the PAYMENT input is `multiple`
// WITHOUT capture so the OS picker can offer gallery multi-select (owner: pick
// all the payment photos in one go — capture forces a one-shot camera and
// ignores `multiple`). No getUserMedia / live video.
//
// The multipart POST reuses authedFetch: it stamps the bearer from
// localStorage['auth:token'], leaves the multipart content-type to the browser
// (so the boundary is set correctly), and applies the long scan timeout for the
// /scan- path. A missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (staging) returns 503
// anthropic_key_missing, which we surface as a clear "not available here" note.

     queued / running  — always listed (grey pill / teal "Reading…" spinner).
     done              — the job IS a draft in Orders now, so it must not
                         linger here: shown ONCE briefly ("Done → SO-xxxx,
