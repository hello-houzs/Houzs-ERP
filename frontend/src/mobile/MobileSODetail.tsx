     order that's past its processing date freezes its LINE ITEMS + State /
     Postcode (that's `editLocked` above, which feeds the Edit button), but
     PAYMENT must STAY addable. Desktop keeps this exact split — its
     PaymentsTable `locked` prop is `isLocked` (SHIPPED+ / downstream children)
     ONLY, deliberately NOT the processing lock. Mirror that here: payment is
     lock-gated only by the terminal / downstream statuses, never by the

     delivered SO is in that list AND has a DO, so its payments were frozen twice
     over. isLocked is the LINE/HEADER lock — those freeze because a DO/SI quotes
     them. Money is not a line, and collecting the balance ON delivery is the
