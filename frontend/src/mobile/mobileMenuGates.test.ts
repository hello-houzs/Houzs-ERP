/**
 * EVERY mobile menu row must state its permission gate. This test is the reason
 * "I forgot to gate this" is a CI failure instead of a silently mis-scoped page.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM IT GUARDS. `MobileApp`'s `allowed(to)` now ends with
 * `matches.length === 0 ? false` — a path with NO NAV_TABS entry is HIDDEN, not
 * shown. That default was fail-OPEN (`? true`) until 2026-07-19, which made every
 * ungated row a page visible to EVERY mobile user, and it produced the same bug
 * twice: once when the desktop /scm/drivers page was retired out from under the
 * mobile row that borrowed its gate, and again when the mobile-only /scm/helpers
 * row was added. Both were caught by a human reading the code; neither by a
 * compiler, because an ungated row is perfectly valid TypeScript.
 *
 * THE FLIP DID NOT REMOVE ANY ROW. The two rows that have no nav gate to borrow —
 * `/activity-inbox` and `/announcements` (see UNGATED_BY_DESIGN) — carry
 * `alwaysShow`, which short-circuits `allowed()` at the filter call sites, so they
 * stay visible under the closed default. Nothing depended on the permissive
 * default itself; the enumeration below (every row names its gate) is what made
 * the flip safe, and the flip is what makes the enumeration true at runtime.
 *
 * WHY THE ENUMERATION STILL MATTERS UNDER FAIL-CLOSED. A row that names no gate no
 * longer leaks — it now VANISHES for the cohort that should see it, silently,
 * because `allowed()` denies an unmatched path. A screen that disappears with
 * nobody deciding it should is its own bug, so every row must still name its gate.
 *
 * WHEN THIS TEST FAILS, DO NOT ADD YOUR PATH TO UNGATED_BY_DESIGN TO GO GREEN.
 * That list is for rows with no permission to apply at all. If the screen reads
 * business data, it needs a real gate: give the row a `to` with a live NAV_TABS
 * entry, or a `gateVia` pointing at one that carries the same permission the
 * backend enforces on the screen's endpoint.

 *   • no gate to borrow — no NAV_TABS entry, so `allowed()` fails open;
 *   • `alwaysShow` — which SKIPS `allowed()` even when a nav entry exists, and is
 *     therefore an ungating mechanism in its own right, not a mere hint.
 *
 * The third test below stops this list from rotting into a blanket exemption: an
 * entry that no longer names a row, or whose row has since become genuinely

 *  lookup because both short-circuit `allowed()` at runtime — a row carrying
 *  `alwaysShow` is ungated whether or not a NAV_TABS entry happens to exist for
 *  its path, so crediting it with that entry's gate would be a false pass.
 *
 *  `capability` replaced `directorOnly`. It is the STRONGEST gate form a row can
 *  carry: the boolean is decided by the backend (services/capabilities.ts) and
 *  read verbatim, so unlike a nav-tab gate it cannot drift from the rule the
 *  endpoint enforces. A row is credited only when the key is one the frontend
 *  actually declares — a typo'd or retired key would otherwise read as a gate
 *  while `capability()` silently returned false for everyone, which is a
 *  fail-CLOSED bug but still a screen that vanished without anyone deciding it
