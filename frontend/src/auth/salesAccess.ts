 *
 * WHY IT IS A HELPER AND NOT A `pageAccess(...)` CALL AT EACH SITE. It was four
 * hand-copies, and they disagreed — which is how the bug the owner reported got
 * in. `DeliveryOrderDetailV2`, `MfgDeliveryOrdersListV2` and `SalesInvoicesListV2`
 * each inlined `["edit","full"].includes(pageAccess(...))`; the SO quick-view
 * drawer's "Deliver" button checked NOTHING (status only) and navigated a
 * salesperson to a route that then rendered <Forbidden>; and the entire mobile
 * convert surface (MobileConvertWizard, the module-list "+", the planning
 * board's Create DO) imported no auth at all. Owner: "電話電腦的權限應該一樣的"
 * — one rule, both platforms, so this is the only place that decides.
 *
 * IT MIRRORS THE BACKEND EXACTLY, which is the property that matters — a button
 * this shows must not 403. `scm/middleware/area-guard` requires `edit` on the
 * area for POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE, and `salesJdAccess.salesJdWriteDenial` denies
 * those writes to the Sales cohort whether or not they are L2-configured. Both
 * terms are reproduced below, in that order:
 *   1. `*` (Owner / IT) always passes — never narrowed, on either side.
 *   2. Sales cohort → false. This is the RULE half. It is not redundant with the
 *      page_access read: the backend writes SALES_JD's `view` into page_access at
 *      login, so term 3 usually agrees on its own — but a stale /auth/me payload
 *      would otherwise re-offer the button the server now refuses.
 *   3. otherwise → the matrix, compared through ACCESS_RANK (the same rank the
 *      backend's meetsLevel uses), so Office keeps exactly what its position
 *      grants and nothing else moves.
 *
 * READS ARE NOT GATED BY THIS. Sales keeps view + Print PDF on both documents
 * (the backend's `readInheritsFrom: "scm.sales.orders"` hatch lets a rep read the
 * DOs and SIs raised off their own SOs). Callers must make the control ABSENT,
 * not disabled — "off, not hide".

 * never have been flipped back. The circularity is the bug, and it stays fixed

 *
 * `cost_price_sen` is not derived and is not an artifact — whatever is in that
 * column is exactly what someone typed. It is simply CONFIDENTIAL. So this gate
 * is about IDENTITY only.

 * — the correction of 2026-07-17. Owner, shown that his 2026-06-13 red line
 * ("Only Purchasing + Finance see cost") was not in force because Purchasing is
 * in no cost cohort:
 *
 *     "那就是采购、Finance，还有 Sales Director 啊？"
 *
 * so: Purchasing + Finance Manager + Sales Director, plus Owner/Super Admin via
 * `*`. This gate read `project_finance_viewer` until now — but that flag answers
 * "are you a PMS DIRECTOR" (isFinanceViewer -> getPmsRole -> DIRECTOR,
 * services/pmsAccess.ts:79,154,256), a question with no Purchasing in it. Two
 * questions had one flag, so an owner ruling sat dead for a month. The fix is
 * NOT to widen project_finance_viewer to admit Purchasing: that flag also opens
 * every project's financial snapshot / rental / payment in PMS and makes its
 * holder isDirectorUser, and the owner asked for cost, not for that. It is to
 * ask the cost question separately — backend pmsAccess.isProductCostViewer,
 * surfaced on /auth/me next to its sibling. Same reasoning as the paragraph
 * above, one level up: keep the two questions apart.
 *
 * project_finance_viewer is OR'd in only as a floor. The cost cohort is a strict
 * SUPERSET of the director cohort (isProductCostViewer = isDirectorUser OR
 * Purchasing), so a director is already true here by construction — this cannot
 * widen the cohort by one user. It exists so a director never loses cost against
 * a backend that predates the new flag (a stale PWA SPA shell is the real case);
 * an old backend then yields exactly the old director-only behaviour. Note the
 * inverse is deliberately absent: `isDirectorUser` above must NEVER read
 * product_cost_viewer, or Purchasing would become a director and inherit the
 * sales-scope gates and the 27 nav flags.
 *
