// permissionDivergence — the frontend gate and the backend gate must AGREE.
//
// This is the remainder of the audit PR #835 opened: sites where the client
// answered a permission question the server was already answering, and answered
// it differently. Each test below names ONE site, the API gate it must match,
// and the direction it was wrong in. Agreement is the entire point of the
// capability registry, and it must not be able to drift again — so it is pinned
// here rather than asserted in a comment.
//
// Source-scanning, for the reason soMaintenanceGate.test.ts states: these gates
// are inline in large components under concurrent edit, and rendering them would
// couple this test to routers, lazy boundaries and query clients, breaking for
// reasons that have nothing to do with the gate. What must not drift is WHICH
// KEY each site reads — which is exactly what the source says.
