/**
 * `isSalesDirectorUser` is the FE mirror of the backend sales-director
 * classification (services/pmsAccess.ts). Position names are owner-editable FREE
 * TEXT, so the matcher keys on EXACT normalised name, not a word-boundary regex: a
 * rename whose name merely CONTAINS a privileged title ("Assistant to Sales
 * Director") must NOT inherit that title's access. The backend is the authority;
 * this guard is UX + defence-in-depth, so it must agree with it.
 *
 * `isDirectorUser` is NO LONGER a FE mirror — it was FOLDED (#835/#839) to read the
 * server-resolved `org.director` capability. The position-name matcher lives once,
 * on the backend (pinned by backend/tests/pmsAccess.test.ts + capabilities.test.ts);
 * here we only pin that the FE helper reads the capability and fails CLOSED without
 * it. So the director LOCKSTEP table moved to the backend and is gone from here.
