// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// projectAccess — the fail-closed reader for the PER-PROJECT `_access` payload.
//
// Owner's architectural ruling, 2026-07-19: the frontend is TOLD a permission,
// it does not compute one. auth/capabilities.ts does that for the answers that
// depend only on WHO you are, resolved once per /auth/me. This module is the
// same contract for the answers that also depend on WHICH PROJECT you are
// looking at — PMS section access is `user × project` (PIC is an assignment,
// projects.pic_id === user.id, not a job title), so it cannot live in a
// per-user capability set. It rides on the project-detail response instead.
//
// The SERVER still decides. `GET /api/projects/:id` computes
// pmsAccess.getPmsAccess(user, project) and ships it as `_access.pms`, and it
// strips finance / payment / sensitive / setup-dismantle from the wire on the
// same flags. This module does not re-derive any of that. Its ONLY job is to
// turn a payload that may be absent, partial, or stale into a fully-populated
// answer WITHOUT ever inventing a grant.
//
// ── WHAT WAS WRONG ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Five call sites treated a MISSING payload as FULL ACCESS. Each was written as
// a kindness to "older cached responses" and each is a fail-open:
//
//   MobilePMS.tsx  `pms.canPayment ?? true`          ← on a MONEY surface
//   MobilePMS.tsx  `(data._access?.level ?? "full") === "full"`
//   MobilePMS.tsx  `pms.canEdit !== false`
//   Projects.tsx   `!detail.data?._access || … === "full"`
//   Projects.tsx   `pms ? pms.canFinancial : fullAccess`
//
// The last one is not merely fail-open, it is fail-open TO THE WRONG COHORT:
// `fullAccess` is the ROW-level tier (PIC vs non-PIC on this project), while
// canFinancial is the SECTION-level finance tier (pmsAccess.isFinanceViewer —
// `*` / Super Admin / Sales Director / Finance Manager). A scoped PIC is
// `level === "full"` on their own project and is NOT a finance viewer. So the
// fallback handed the Finance Ledger + Financial Snapshot to every project's
// own PIC the moment `_access.pms` went missing.
//
// `?? true` on a payment card is the same defect class as the `?? []` that made
// a 403 render as an empty dropdown, and as the `?? 0` that printed a
// customer-facing SO PDF claiming the full amount owed. A permission we could
// not read is NO.
//
// ── THE CONTRACT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every reader goes through {@link readProjectAccess}. It returns a FULLY
// POPULATED, all-boolean shape — never partial, never undefined, so a call site
// cannot distinguish "absent" from "false" and therefore cannot be edited into
// treating absent as yes. There is no `?? true`, no `?? "full"`, no `|| {}` and
// no empty-object default in this file, and there must never be one.
//
// An absent payload is a BROKEN DEPLOYMENT, not a user without permissions —
// the backend has sent `_access.pms` unconditionally since the PMS section model
// shipped, so the only ways to see one missing are a stale PWA shell, a Pages
// deploy ahead of the Worker, or a truncated response. {@link projectAccessUnresolved}
// names that state so a caller can say "we couldn't load your permissions for
// this project" instead of the very different "you don't have permission".
