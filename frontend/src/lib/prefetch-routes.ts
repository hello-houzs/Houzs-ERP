/**
 * Route-chunk prefetching — hides the first-click stall on a lazy route.
 *
 * Every page in App.tsx is `lazy()`, so the first visit to a page downloads its
 * chunk BEFORE the page can even start fetching its data: the user clicks, gets
 * <PageSkeleton>, and waits out a network round trip that nothing warned us
 * about. Two cheap predictions cover most of it — warm a short list of routes
 * while the browser is idle (below), and warm a route when the pointer rests on
 * its sidebar link (Sidebar.tsx calls prefetchRoute on hover).
 *
 * This is a pure optimisation: everything here is allowed to fail, be skipped,
 * or never run at all, and the app must behave identically. `lazy()` still owns
 * the real load on click — we only try to have already paid for it.
 */

/**
 * Path -> chunk loader. The keys are pathnames (no query — see routeKey); the
 * values re-issue the SAME dynamic import as the matching `lazy()` in App.tsx.
 *
 * Each specifier MUST resolve to the exact module App.tsx imports. Rollup keys
 * its module graph by RESOLVED path, so `../pages/X` here and `./pages/X` there
 * are one module and one chunk — the `../` is only this file living one
 * directory deeper. What would break it is resolving somewhere ELSE (a barrel
 * that re-exports the page, a near-duplicate filename): that emits a SECOND
 * chunk, so we would download the page twice and make the stall worse instead
 * of shorter. Keep these paths a mirror of App.tsx's, nothing cleverer.
 *
 * Drift is caught by the build, not at runtime: rename a page and this file
 * stops resolving, so `tsc -b && vite build` fails in CI rather than shipping a
 * prefetch that 404s. A route that isn't listed here simply isn't prefetched.
 *
 * Sidebar-reachable pages only — a route nothing links to has no hover to warm
 * it, and the idle list below is deliberately far shorter than this map.

/**
 * Routes warmed while the browser is idle, in priority order — the queue is
 * serial, so this IS the download order.
 *
 * Eight of 110, on purpose. Warming everything would pull the whole ~1.3 MB
 * lazy tail (scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs) into every session to save a stall
 * on the two or three pages that session opens — worse than the disease, and
 * billed to every user on every cold load. So the list is only what is either
 * near-certain to be needed or leveraged across many routes:
 *
 *  1. the 2990 shell        — ~1 KB that ~100 /scm/* routes each need on top of
 *                             their own chunk; pays for itself on any SCM click
 *  2. Sales Orders list     — the one page promoted to a top-level sidebar
 *                             shortcut, and the whole of a sales rep's SCM tree
 *  3. Sales Order detail    — every row of (2) opens it
 *  4. Supply Chain hub      — where the "Supply Chain" nav header lands
 *  5. Delivery Orders       — the SO's downstream doc; rep-visible leaf
 *  6. Sales Invoices        — same, one step further downstream
 *  7. My Cases              — where a rep's "Service Cases" header lands, ~4 KB
 *  8. Overview              — costs nothing when the user landed on "/" (already
 *                             in the module cache, so the import resolves with
 *                             no request); covers arriving via a deep link
 *
 * The Service Cases board and Projects are NOT here, though both are top-level
 * sections: they are by far the two largest page modules in the app and would
 * have been ~70% of this list's bytes on their own, spent on whichever team
 * doesn't use them. They are what the hover path is for — a section that big is
 * reached by pointing at its nav entry, which warms it a beat before the click.
 *
 * Not gated on permissions: static and short costs a warehouse-only user a few
 * chunks they won't open, which is cheaper in bytes AND complexity than teaching
 * the prefetcher the auth matrix. Revisit that trade before growing this list.
