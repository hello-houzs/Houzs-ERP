// Lightweight localStorage snapshot for the SCM document-list queries, modelled
// on HOOKKA's cached-fetch layer: render the last-known list INSTANTLY on a cold
// open (fresh session / full reload / PWA reopen) and revalidate in the
// background — no full-load spinner. react-query's in-memory cache already makes
// warm re-visits instant; this survives a reload, which the in-memory cache does
// not.
//
// HOOKKA guardrails baked in:
//   - Per-BUILD namespace (bug 1b/2f): the key carries __BUILD_ID__ so a deploy
//     that changes a list's payload SHAPE can't hydrate the previous build's
//     shape; old-build snapshots are pruned on boot.
//   - Per-SESSION namespace (off-not-hide, 2026-07-16): the key also carries a
//     fingerprint of the bearer TOKEN, so one user's snapshot can never hydrate
//     into another user's session. Without this the snapshot was keyed by build +
//     company ONLY, so signing out of an admin account and signing in as a
//     restricted one on the same browser hydrated the ADMIN's rows — the list
//     painted them, then the scoped refetch removed them (render-then-hide).
//   - Logged-out browsers hold NO snapshot: with no token we prune and never
//     hydrate, so business rows don't sit at rest after sign-out.
//   - Never trusted as fresh: hydrated data is stamped stale so the first mount
//     always refetches (cache-while-revalidate).
//   - Whitelisted to the document LISTS only (not detail / sub-resource queries),
//     size-capped, and fail-soft on quota / corruption.
