// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// routeAliases.ts — URL standardisation, step 1: make reasonable guesses work.
//
// Owner ruling (2026-07): "是的 整理過 整個讓系統更加standardise", with the
// non-negotiable condition that EVERY OLD PATH KEEPS WORKING. Staff have
// bookmarks, links are already pasted into chats and emails, and the PWA
// service worker caches by URL.
//
// ── WHY THIS SHIPS ALIASES AND RENAMES NOTHING ────────────────────────────
// The paths in this app are not merely addresses — several are IDENTIFIERS,
// and renaming one without renaming every mirror of it fails SILENTLY and,
// in two places, fails OPEN (a gated screen becomes visible to everyone):
//
//   · `frontend/src/mobile/MobileApp.tsx` `allowed()` resolves a mobile row's
//     permission by looking its path up in `NAV_TABS` — and when no entry
//     matches it returns TRUE. So renaming a `to:` in `Sidebar.tsx` without
//     renaming the matching `MOBILE_MENU_GROUPS` row UNGATES that screen.
//   · `/scm/reports/fulfillment-costing` carries `requireFinanceViewer` on the
//     Sidebar entry ONLY; the mobile row has no gate of its own and borrows it
//     by path. Same for `/reports/fair-report` (`requireFairReport`) and
//     `/scm/delivery-returns` (`hideForSales`).
//   · `gateVia: "/scm/fleet"` IS the permission for the mobile Drivers and
//     Helpers screens.
//   · `mobileRoute.ts` `SO_RESERVED_SEGMENTS` contains the bare string
//     `"maintenance"` — it is the only thing stopping
//     `/scm/sales-orders/maintenance` being parsed as a document number.
//
// A rename touching any of those is a permission regression that nobody
// reports — the screen just quietly stops appearing, or quietly appears for
// everyone. So step 1 is purely ADDITIVE: no `to:` value changes, no gate key
// moves, no route is removed or renamed. The proposed renames are documented
// and sequenced for a later, dedicated PR.
//
// ── WHAT THIS FIXES TODAY ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The reported pain was a route 404-ing "purely because a /scm prefix was
// missing from a reasonable guess". These aliases make the guess RESOLVE
// instead of hitting the not-found page — the practical half of
// standardisation, with none of the identifier risk.
//
// ── SAFETY PROPERTY ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each alias renders `<Navigate replace>` to its canonical path. It grants NO
// access of its own: authorization is enforced entirely by the destination
// route's existing guard, exactly as if the user had typed the canonical URL.
// `replace` keeps the alias out of session history so Back behaves.
//
// When the renames in step 2 land, entries here flip direction (the old path
// becomes the alias, the new one canonical) and this table is where that
// happens — one file, already covered by tests.
