/* lastTick lives in its OWN context (2026-07-19 perf).
   -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   It is a POLL HEARTBEAT: it changes every 30s by definition, whether or not
   anything about the notifications actually changed. While it sat in the main
   context value, that value was a new object every 30 seconds, so all EIGHT
   consumers of useNotifications() re-rendered on a fixed timer — forever, on
   every page. Two of those consumers are the heaviest trees in the app
   (pages/Projects.tsx and the Layout's MobileTabBar), and the provider is
   mounted at the App root, so the whole screen paid a re-render every half
   minute regardless of what the user was doing. That is a timer-driven 卡顿
   with no data behind it.

   Exactly ONE consumer needs the heartbeat — components/BrowserPushSink.tsx,
   which renders null and uses it to decide whether to fire an OS banner. Giving
   it a dedicated context means the tick re-renders that one null-rendering
   component and nothing else.

   The heartbeat is deliberately still set on EVERY poll, even when the payload
   is unchanged. BrowserPushSink's priming step (`!primed && lastTick > 0`)
   depends on the tick advancing after the first successful poll, and a first
   poll that legitimately returns an empty feed must still prime — otherwise the
   next poll's items would be silently marked seen instead of notified. */
