 * The heartbeat only fires while the tab is visible.
 *
 * SINGLETON: usePresence is mounted by more than one component at once
 * (PresenceIndicator in the top bar + PresencePanel in the sidebar). Previously
 * each mount ran its own poll, so every page fired 2+ GET /api/presence AND
 * 2+ POST heartbeat. This module-level singleton runs ONE poll + heartbeat and
 * fans the result out to all consumers, so N mounts cost one request per tick.
 *
 * Never re-polls on window focus for fresh data (MIN_TICK_GAP_MS), and the
 * idle-stop is DEFERRED: a same-commit unmount+remount of every consumer (a
 * layout swap, or effects re-running) no longer kills and restarts the poller
 * — a restart's ensureStarted() fired an immediate extra tick each time.
