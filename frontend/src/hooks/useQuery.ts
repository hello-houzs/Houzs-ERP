 * `fetcher.toString()`, which is a correctness bug, not a style one: two
 * callsites whose fetcher bodies happen to be textually identical silently
 * SHARE one cache entry, so one screen can render another's data. That is not
 * hypothetical — 50 of the 126 callsites in this app had a textual twin. They
 * survived only because every twin happened to hit the same endpoint and want
 * the same shape; the first pair that didn't would have cross-fed data with
 * nothing in the diff to suggest it. Minification makes it worse, not better:
 * the bundler collapses whitespace, so two bodies that differ only in
 * formatting are distinct in dev and identical in production.
 *
 * Two callsites SHOULD share a key when they want the same data — that is
 * request dedup and it is the reason the mail-center and projects lookups are
 * cheap. They must NOT share one when the result differs in shape or in error
 * behaviour, because only ONE queryFn runs per key.
 *
 * Callsites must still keep their dynamic values in `deps` — the key names the
 * QUESTION, the deps supply its PARAMETERS.
