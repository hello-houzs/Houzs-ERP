# Houzs ERP — BUG HISTORY

**STANDING RULE (owner, 2026-07-14): every bug that is found and fixed MUST be logged here — no exceptions, everyone.** One entry per bug: **Symptom** (what the user saw) → **Root cause** (the actual defect, traced not guessed) → **Fix** (what changed) → **Ref** (PR / commit / date). Keep entries short. This file exists so the same class of bug is never reintroduced — read it before touching a subsystem, and mine it before shipping. Newest first.

Severity tags: 🔴 critical/high · 🟠 medium · 🟢 low.

## 2026-07-14 — Multi-company + performance campaign

### 🟢 Mobile Delivery Planning board didn't refresh the POD / SO screens after a mutation
- **Symptom:** A driver who converts SO→DO, or marks a stop IN_TRANSIT / DELIVERED, on the mobile Delivery Planning board, then opens the mobile POD screen or SO list within ~15-30s, saw the PRE-mutation status/list. Self-healed after the staleTime window.
- **Cause:** The board's shared `invalidate()` helper (`MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx`) invalidated only its own `["mobile-delivery-planning"]` key. The sibling mobile queries that render the same DO/SO state — `["mobile-do-list-for-pod"]`, `["mobile-pod-detail", id]`, `["mobile-so-list"]` — were never invalidated in the writing tab (BroadcastChannel doesn't deliver to the tab that wrote), so they stayed stale until their own staleTime expired. Same class as HOOKKA's bulk-deliver/POD stale-list bug (desktop was already fully disciplined — it invalidates every sibling key).
- **Fix:** Broaden the shared `invalidate()` to also invalidate `mobile-do-list-for-pod`, `mobile-pod-detail` (prefix-matched, all open details), and `mobile-so-list`. All four board mutations (convert / start / complete / +1) get it uniformly.
- **Ref:** `perf/mobile-virt-systemwide`, 2026-07-14. (Found by a system-wide delivery-cache audit; the two other HOOKKA-flagged risks — CHECK-constraint 500s and silent RM0 3PL rate — were verified NOT present in Houzs.)
### 🟢 Mail Center empty-state copy claimed a mechanism that doesn't exist (misleading)
- **Symptom:** Owner opened Mail Center under the 2990 company, saw an empty inbox with "No mailbox assigned yet" + "Incoming mail will appear here once the domain MX is switched to Cloudflare and the inbound Worker is live", and thought receiving had broken ("之前有 email 进来了 为什么又没有了").
- **Cause:** TWO things. (1) The empty-state copy was hand-carried from Hookka and describes an MX-cutover inbound path Houzs never used — Houzs inbound is a Gmail IMAP pull (`mail-sync` GitHub Action, every 5 min; MX stays on Google Workspace). The claim was simply false and alarming. (2) No actual data loss: since migration 0107 the mail tables carry `company_id` and `getMailScope` / threads are scoped to the ACTIVE company; the owner's `hello@` mailbox + history belong to HOUZS (company 1), so viewing under 2990 (company 2) correctly shows nothing.
- **Fix:** Replaced the copy with the truth — mail syncs automatically every few minutes, and it is scoped to the active company so an empty mailbox usually means the company selector is on the wrong company. (No backend change; the scoping is working as designed.)
- **Ref:** `fix/mail-empty-copy`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Mobile Menu listed nav items the user can't open (render-then-Forbidden)
- **Symptom:** At tablet / narrow widths (`<lg`) and on non-HOUZS mobile, the bottom-bar centre "Menu" sheet listed destinations the user has no access to (Projects, System Health for everyone; Delivery Returns for Sales staff); tapping bounced them to the Forbidden page. The desktop Sidebar and the HOUZS-phone menu hid the same items correctly.
- **Cause:** `MobileTabBar.MenuModal.filterTab` was a hand-copied SUBSET of `Sidebar.filterTab`: it checked only `perm` / `anyPerm` / `hidePerm` and ignored `pageAccess`, `pageAccessFull`, `requireFinanceViewer` and every sales gate (`hideForSales` / `showForSales` / rep gates). A comment claimed the two "stay in lockstep" — they had silently drifted. No data leaked (route guards still render `<Forbidden>` instead of the page), but a denied entry was shown then rejected — the "render-then-deny" that the "off, not hide" rule forbids at the nav layer.
- **Fix:** Extract the full gate logic into a shared `frontend/src/components/navFilter.ts` (`makeNavFilter`); both `Sidebar` and `MobileTabBar` build their menu from it, so a third divergent copy cannot drift again. Mobile also gains the sales-rep `salesRepTo` reachable-click-target override for free. Verified `tsc -b` + `vite build` green.
- **Ref:** `fix/mobile-nav-perm-parity`, 2026-07-14.
### 🟠 Inventory list showed negative / inflated "Available" for partially-shipped or multi-company SKUs
- **Symptom:** On the Inventory product list (`GET /inventory/products`), a SKU could show a wrongly negative `available_qty` (e.g. on-hand 6, gross open SO qty 10 → Available −4 when the true free-to-sell was 0), and in multi-company a shared SKU's Reserved/Available was distorted by the OTHER company's orders.
- **Cause:** The Reserved / reserve_7d / reserve_14d KPIs summed the **gross** open SO-line qty. (1) Delivered qty (net of returns) was never subtracted, so a partially-shipped SO double-counted its already-shipped units → `available_qty = stock − reserved` went negative. (2) The demand query had **no company scoping** while the stock figure (`v_inventory_product_totals`) and the open-lots query WERE company-scoped, so a shared SKU subtracted other companies' demand from this company's stock.
- **Fix:** Each SO line now contributes `max(0, qty − delivered + returned)`. Delivered = non-cancelled **AND non-draft** DOs (a DRAFT DO hasn't shipped / hasn't moved stock, so counting it would inflate Available → over-sell risk); returned = non-cancelled DRs traced through the active DO line (DRs have no DRAFT state). The demand query is also wrapped in `scopeToCompany(...)` like the lots/totals queries in the same file.
- **Ref:** `fix/inventory-reserved-available`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Company switch kept showing the previous company's list (cross-tenant stale)
- **Symptom:** Switching company in the top-bar switcher (Houzs↔2990) left the products / SO lists showing the PREVIOUS company's data (Houzs 1326 rows still under 2990); a hard refresh fixed it. Time-good-time-bad (a race).
- **Cause:** The active company is header-based (`X-Company-Id`, read fresh from localStorage per request — so the header AND the backend scoping were correct). But react-query keys don't include the company, so company A's and B's data share one cache entry. `invalidateQueries()` raced (keepPreviousData kept A's rows / an in-flight A response repopulated the shared entry); and a first fix attempt with `queryClient.clear()` was insufficient — clear() empties the cache but does NOT re-trigger a mounted observer to refetch. Proven on prod: a remount (nav away+back) switched correctly to 2990's "2990 AKKA-FIRM MATT", an in-place clear() did not.
- **Fix:** The switch handler now does `window.location.reload()` (a tenant switch is fundamental + rare) so the whole app re-reads the company header on every request. PLUS the new localStorage query-snapshot (`query-persist.ts`) is namespaced by active company so a cold open can't hydrate the other company's list.
- **Ref:** `fix/multicompany-cache-staleness` (#445, snapshot namespace) + `fix/company-switch-reload` (#450, reload), 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Service-worker cache VERSION bumped by hand → stale shell / branch collisions
- **Symptom:** After some deploys the PWA served a stale shell ("卡旧版本" / 开不进去); parallel branches bumped `sw.js` `VERSION` to the SAME `vNNN` and collided (git: "bump v172 (branch collided with #421's v171 on main)").
- **Cause:** `public/sw.js` used a hand-edited `const VERSION = "houzs-erp-vNNN"`; the cache namespace + activate-purge key off it, so a forgotten or colliding bump left the old shell cache in place.
- **Fix:** Auto-stamp the build id: `sw.js` carries a `__SW_BUILD_ID__` token that a `vite.config` `writeBundle` plugin replaces with a unique per-build id → every deploy yields a new VERSION → the SW's activate step purges the previous caches automatically. No manual bump. Verified: `dist/sw.js` → `const VERSION = "houzs-erp-v176-mrk9db8r"`, 0 leftover tokens.
- **Ref:** `perf/sw-auto-version`, 2026-07-14.

## 2026-07-14 — Go-live review batch (4-agent adversarial + FE/BE sweep)

### 🔴 POD signature + photo silently discarded
- **Symptom:** Every proof-of-delivery lost — driver signs + photographs a delivery, DO flips to DELIVERED but `signature_data`/`pod_r2_key` stay NULL; the delivery-agent flags every delivered DO as "missing POD" forever.
- **Cause:** `PATCH /delivery-orders-mfg/:id/status` handler typed its body as `{status?}` and only read `body.status` — it never read/persisted the `signatureData`/`podKey` the mobile POD screen sends.
- **Fix:** Read + persist `signatureData→signature_data` and `podKey→pod_r2_key` in the status handler.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🔴 Sales Order write routes had NO ownership scope (horizontal privilege)
- **Symptom:** A scoped salesperson could PATCH/delete/repay/reassign **any** SO by enumerable doc_no (reads were correctly scoped to self+downline, writes were not).
- **Cause:** `selfScopedSalesBlocked()` in `mfg-sales-orders.ts` was a no-op stub (`return false`) — its comment wrongly assumed "no self-scoped sellers in Houzs", but `salesScope` returns a real self+downline scope for every non-view-all caller.
- **Fix:** Implement it via `salesDocOutOfScope` (own+downline; director/view-all bypass) on all mutation routes.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🔴 Service Case "Export CSV" always 500
- **Symptom:** Export CSV on Service Cases returned 500 for everyone.
- **Cause:** `exportAssrCases` selected `c.customer_phone`, but the `assr_cases` column is `phone`.
- **Fix:** `SELECT c.phone AS customer_phone` (CSV field list expects `customer_phone`).
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🔴 "New Delivery Return" (free-entry) was an unsaveable dead-end
- **Symptom:** The standalone New Delivery Return form (and any manual line added to a From-DO return) always 409'd on Save — could never be saved.
- **Cause:** FE offered a free-entry mode (lines with no `doItemId`) but the backend requires every DR line to reference a delivered DO line (`409 do_link_required`).
- **Fix:** FE now requires lines to come from a DO (block save + disable manual add; steer to the From-DO picker).
- **Ref:** `fix/review-frontend-forms`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Sales Director could change a dept member's login email (account-takeover vector)
- **Symptom:** A dept-scoped Sales Director (not a full admin) could rewrite a member's `email`/`email_alias`, then use forgot-password to take over the account.
- **Cause:** The `#435` dept-scoped strip removed role/position/department/manager/password but forgot `email`/`email_alias`.
- **Fix:** Add `delete body.email; delete body.email_alias;` to the scoped-director branch.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 SCM backend umbrella had no org-field bypass for Sales (FE shows, BE 403s)
- **Symptom:** A code-keyed Sales rep (org position/dept set, no permission-matrix grant) was shown Sales Orders by the FE (`allowSales`) but 403'd by the backend `requireScmAccess` umbrella.
- **Cause:** `requireScmAccess`/`scmAreaGuard` admitted only on `*`/`scm.access`/scm page-access — no `isSalesStaff` bypass, unlike ASSR's `canAccessServiceCases`. FE toast-suppression papered over it instead of aligning.
- **Fix:** Add an `isSalesStaff`-limited bypass to the umbrella for the Sales-Orders area only.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Variant completeness bypassable via line routes on a processing-dated SO
- **Symptom:** After a Processing Date is set (which requires complete variants), a later PATCH to a line could blank its fabric — leaving an incomplete processing-dated SO.
- **Cause:** `findIncompleteVariantLines` ran only on create + header-PATCH, not on the item POST/PATCH routes.
- **Fix:** Re-check variant completeness on the line routes when `internal_expected_dd` is set.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Service-case co-assignee (`assigned_to_2`) sees a case in the list but 404s on open
- **Symptom:** A secondary assignee sees the case row in the list, clicks it, gets 404.
- **Cause:** List scope included `assigned_to_2` but the detail + sub-route scope checks considered only `created_by`/`assigned_to`.
- **Fix:** Add `assigned_to_2` to the detail + `caseInCallerScope` checks.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Consignment Order missing the sofa-mix pre-guard (raw 400 after Save)
- **Symptom:** A sofa+bedframe consignment cart only failed after clicking Save (backend `so_sofa_no_other_main`); SO pages block it instantly.
- **Fix:** Add `hasSofaMixConflict`/`SOFA_MIX_MESSAGE` pre-save guard to ConsignmentOrderNew (parity with SO).
- **Ref:** `fix/review-frontend-forms`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟠 Misleading required `*` markers on doc forms
- **Symptom:** Phone / Email / Receive-Date / Supplier-Invoice-# showed a red `*` (some with inert HTML `required`) but neither FE nor BE enforced them — operators thought fields were mandatory.
- **Fix:** Remove the `*`/`required` from the non-enforced fields across DO/SI/CN/CR/DR/GRN/PC-Receive/PI New forms (kept legitimately-required stars).
- **Ref:** `fix/review-frontend-forms`, 2026-07-14.

### 🟢 Copy/consistency
- Processing-date-gate reason still said "50%" on the PATCH-header path while the gate is 30% → fixed copy + comment.
- `isSalesUser` (BE `/^Sales /i`, trailing space) vs `isSalesStaff` (FE `/^sales/i`) disagreed on "Salesperson"/"Sales-Executive" → aligned BE to FE.
- Sales-Director member edit checked primary dept only while the list included secondary (`user_departments`) → PATCH gate now accepts `user_departments`.
- Mail-Center Sales-Director dept match was a loose bidirectional substring ("Presales"/"Wholesales") + generic dept scope derived dept from an owned mailbox → tightened.
- `assr` `/cost-suggestion` + `/customer-history` were `service_cases.read`-gated → over-restricted a scoped Sales viewer of a case → switched to `requireServiceCaseAccess` + in-scope.
- **Ref:** `fix/review-backend-batch` / `fix/review-frontend-forms`, 2026-07-14.

## 2026-07-14 — Sales access model + SO-form FE/BE (earlier same night, all SHIPPED)

- 🔴 **Cross-salesperson finance leak** — Sales-Invoice / Consignment / Delivery-Order **detail + `/payments`** reads were unscoped (only the LIST query got the new own+downline scope). Any scoped rep could enumerate ids and read another rep's invoice header + full payment history. Fix: `salesDocOutOfScope` on every detail/sub-read. (PR #417)
- 🔴 **Company P&L + activity-feed leaked finance to non-director Sales** — `finance.ts /pnl` gated only on `projects.read`; `/:id/activity` replayed payment_status/finance markers the detail GET blanks. Fix: `financeHiddenForUser` gate + drop finance rows from activity. (PR #397)
- 🟠 **Home dashboard "Forbidden" toast storm** — `Overview.tsx` fired `/api/assr/summary` + `/api/projects/summary` for every user; a Sales rep without the perm got a Forbidden toast on every load. Fix: off-not-hide `enabled: can(perm)` gate. Also `/api/notifications` was matrix-gated (should be personal) → widened. (PR #421)
- 🟠 **`useQuery(fetcher, {enabled})` silently ignored** — the hook's options is the **3rd** arg (2nd is deps); the gate was passed as deps and never applied (+ broke `tsc -b`). Fix: `useQuery(fetcher, [], {enabled})`. (PR #417)
- 🟠 **My Cases unreachable for Sales** — nav showed it (dept bypass) but the `/my-cases` route's `PageGuard` denied on the matrix. Fix: `allowSales` bypass on the route. (PR #417)
- 🟠 **Sales Director didn't see all Sales Orders** — SO view-all keyed off the `scm.so.view_all` permission, not the director position (unlike cases/finance). Fix: `canViewAllSales` OR-ins `isDirectorUser`. (PR #410)
- 🟠 **Salespeople couldn't amend their own locked SO** — submit gate required `scm.amendment.create` (not granted to reps). Fix: admit `isSalesCaller` + scope to own SO via `salesDocOutOfScope`. (PR #423)
- 🟠 **`isSalesStaff` failed OPEN** on non-space titles ("Salesperson") → treated as unrestricted (would see Delivery Returns/Finance). Fix: key off `department_name` + broadened regex. (PR #417)
- 🟠 **Projects list open to all** — the list lacked the sales-attendee arm the calendar/detail use, so an attendee saw a project on the calendar but 404'd opening it. Fix: add the attendee arm to the list read gate. (PR #425)
- 🟠 **Fabric/Seat marked required with no Processing Date** — FE `SoLineCard` rendered the `*`/red-border unconditionally + mobile blocked Save on Draft-vs-Confirm, but the backend only requires variants when a Processing Date is set. Fix: FE visual + mobile block now gate on `!!processingDate` (matches BE). (PR #441)
- 🟠 **Special add-ons showed nothing for un-configured models** — FE offered `special_addons ∩ model.allowed_options.specials`, so an empty model pool ⇒ "No specials configured", while the backend accepts/prices any picked special when the pool is empty. Owner rule: specials are uniform (default all on). Fix: empty pool ⇒ offer ALL; non-empty ⇒ intersection. (PR #441)
- 🟠 **Processing-date payment gate used 50% (2990 rule) on Houzs** — Houzs requires 30%. Fix: new `PROCESSING_DATE_PAID_THRESHOLD=0.30` (kept `PROCEED_PAID_THRESHOLD=0.5` for the other gate). (PR #441)
- 🟢 **Raw 400s** for `so_sofa_no_other_main` + `processing_date_unpaid` → curated one-sentence messages via `humanApiError`. (PR #441)
- 🟢 **Agent Console** `/review` scorecard was a stub, Document agent had no AI-focus, `recentErrors`/run-history were computed but never rendered → completed (advisory-only, no red-line). (PR #406)

## Earlier (2026-06 → 07, backfilled 2026-07-14 from memory / COE docs / git)

*Historical entries reconstructed after the fact — dates approximate, refs to the COE docs where a full write-up exists.*

### Infrastructure / deploy / DB
- 🔴 **App-wide intermittent 500 "Something went wrong"** — `middleware/db.ts` attached the per-request DB client by **mutating the shared isolate-level `c.env`** (`c.env.DB = …`); under concurrent requests one request ran queries on another's socket → `Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request`, which matched no error classifier and fell through to a generic 500. Worse under load. Fix: stop mutating shared env; per-request client via `c.set`. Full write-up: `docs/system-foundation-coe.md`.
- 🔴 **"Failed to fetch" storms** — Hyperdrive **cold-start (~12s)** + a 15-connection cap; bursts exhausted the pool. Fix: `pool_size` 40 + GET retry/backoff. See `docs/api-fetch-hardening-coe.md`.
- 🔴 **App-wide 500s after D1→Postgres migration** — the D1→PG move **dropped column DEFAULTs** (e.g. `active DEFAULT 1`) on ~10 tables, so inserts that relied on them 500'd. Fix: `ALTER … SET DEFAULT` per table.
- 🔴 **Mass 500s / "Usage limit exceeded"** — Cloudflare **FREE Workers plan** daily caps hit under real load. Fix: upgrade to Workers Paid. (Also: GitHub Actions budget block on a private repo → made repo public = free/unlimited.)
- 🟠 **Post-deploy "database briefly unavailable" 503** — Hyperdrive cold-start after each deploy; self-heals, but **burst-deploying multiplies it**. Standing rule: don't burst-deploy. (`pg.ts` is frozen.)
- 🟠 **App-wide 503 + deploys fail `pg-migrate` "password auth failed" while project Healthy** — Supabase **Shared Pooler (Supavisor) outage**; fix = Restart project.
- 🟠 **"Version 跑回 old" after deploy** — manual `wrangler` deploy colliding with CI deploy. Fix: let CI own deploys; scoped-diff on isolated worktrees.
- 🟠 **PWA "开不进去" after rapid deploys** — service-worker cache churn. Recover by bumping `sw.js` VERSION; don't burst-deploy the PWA.
- 🟠 **Schema change deployed but broke prod** — Houzs keeps TWO migration trees (`migrations/` D1 + `migrations-pg/` prod); a change in only one slips through until deploy runs `pg-migrate`. Rule: update BOTH.

### Data / postgres.js quirks (the #1 recurring class)
- 🔴 **Rows read as `undefined` / features silently empty** — `postgres.js` **camelCases** returned columns while PostgREST/raw SQL uses snake_case; code reading one shape got null. Fix: dual-read `r.camelCase ?? r.snake_case`. This is the single most common Houzs bug — check it first when data "isn't there".
- 🔴 **SCM stock never moved after the 2990 SCM port** — the port **dropped all PL/pgSQL functions + triggers**, so ledger/FIFO movement logic was gone. Fix: restored 12 functions + 2 triggers (pin `search_path=scm`).
- 🟠 **PG `timestamp` columns rejected `datetime('now')`** — SQLite idiom carried over; must be a text/ISO timestamp on PG.
- 🟠 **Variant columns dropped on SO→DO / DO→SI conversion** — carry-over logic omitted variant cols; downstream docs lost fabric/seat. Fix + backfill.

### Frontend
- 🔴 **Whole-page "Something went wrong" (route crash)** — the #1 cause is a component reading `{success,data}` **without unwrapping `.data`** (`api.get` does NOT unwrap). Route `ErrorBoundary` (`RouteFallback.tsx`) now resets on nav (PR #371).
- 🟠 **CI "tsc false-clean" in worktrees** — a frontend worktree without `node_modules` reports a false-clean local `tsc`; only CI's `tsc -b && vite build` is authoritative. Verify via CI, not local.
- 🟠 **Vendored SCM fetch hit the wrong base URL** — `VITE_API_URL` inlined empty at build; `?? worker` kept the empty string. Fix: use `|| worker`.
- 🟠 **Cloudflare Pages `_headers` over-broad** — Pages MERGES rules; keep only `/index.html` + `/assets/*` or headers leak to all routes.

### SCM correctness (mostly caught pre-Houzs on 2990, verified on Houzs)
- 🟠 **GRN defaulted warehouse to CHINA-transit** → false MRP alarms. Fix + GRN 防呆.
- 🟠 **Sofa drop-ship DO missing the 7 corner-holes line** → under-built. Fixed Houzs (PR #349).
