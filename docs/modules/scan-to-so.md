# Module: Scan to Sales Order (OCR)

Per-module technical doc — a phone photo of a handwritten showroom slip becomes
a DRAFT Sales Order, and the operator's corrections train the next scan. Same
structure as [`sales-order.md`](./sales-order.md).

> Verified against `main` @ `8f8427ed`. Where `docs/ocr-self-evolution.md`
> describes something that is not in the tree at this commit, §5 says so
> explicitly — that document mixes shipped and unshipped.

> Convention: the module lives in the **`scm` Postgres schema**
> (`scm.so_scan_samples`, `scm.so_scan_rules`, `scm.scan_jobs`) and is reached
> under `/api/scm/scan-so/*`. The one exception is the completion notice, which
> is written to `public.announcements`.

## 1. Frontend

### Screens

| Surface | File | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop "Scan Order" modal | `frontend/src/vendor/scm/components/ScanOrderModal.tsx` (833 lines) | multi-order batch: N slips in one session, one `/enqueue` per order |
| Mobile Scan screen | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileScan.tsx` (1,278 lines) | the primary surface — the rep photographs the slip in the showroom |
| Shared job helper | `frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/scan-jobs.ts` | the `ScanJob` shape, the camel/snake dual-read normaliser, the time predicates |
| Shared prefill reconciler | `frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/scan-prefill.ts` (297 lines) | `reconcileScanPrefill()` — pure function, no hooks, no fetch |
| Job cards on the SO list | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileSalesOrders.tsx` | re-exports through `MobileScan` |

Both shells now take the **same** path: `POST /scan-so/enqueue` per order, then
poll `GET /scan-so/jobs` through `scan-jobs.ts`
(`ScanOrderModal.tsx:53-58`, `MobileScan.tsx:65-71`). The desktop modal used to
run a blocking `POST /scan-so/extract` for a single order and no longer calls
`/extract` itself (`ScanOrderModal.tsx:174`). Mobile keeps `/extract` only as a
fallback for when `/enqueue` 404s on an older deploy (`MobileScan.tsx:72`,
`submitLegacy` `:801-811`).

The shared layer is a plain module, **not a React hook**:
`vendor/scm/lib/scan-jobs.ts` exports the `ScanJob` type, `normalizeJobs`,
`jobTs`, `isTodayTs`, `hhmm` and `isActiveJob`. Its header says it exists so the
desktop modal reuses mobile's code path rather than keeping a third copy
(`scan-jobs.ts:1-12`).

Where the two surfaces still differ (all deliberate):

| | Desktop modal | Mobile Scan |
|---|---|---|
| Poll predicate | this session's enqueued ids (`:323-328`) | any listed job active (`:536-537`) |
| Visible jobs | everything enqueued this session | **today only**, and `done` rows are hidden — active + `error` only (`:167`, `:541-553`) |
| Legacy `/extract` fallback | none | yes (`:707`, `:877`) |
| "Clear failed" button | none | yes (`:566`) |
| After the draft lands | a button that closes and navigates to `/scm/sales-orders` (`:807`) — no toast | a toast driven by job polling, with a localStorage ack set (`MobileSalesOrders.tsx:65-70`, `:270-340`) |

Both poll at **4,000 ms** while anything is unsettled and stop entirely when
everything settles.

### `scan-prefill.ts` is the file that made mobile OCR work

Its header (`scan-prefill.ts:1-30`) is the clearest statement of the desktop/mobile
trap in this module. The *extraction* was always shared (it is server-side), but
the **client-side mapping of the extract result into the New SO form had
drifted**: desktop reconciled the raw OCR values against the real catalog (venue
text to venue id, dropdown value snapping, SOFA `specialCodes`, a structured
bank/plan/One-Shot payment block) while mobile took the raw strings and its
consumer then re-guarded them against *stale hardcoded lists*. Same server, same
JSON, and "mobile OCR doesn't work". `reconcileScanPrefill()` is now the single
source of that mapping; value snapping is deliberately non-destructive
(`snapValue`) — a value the live catalog does not contain is kept as-is rather
than dropped.

### Loading behaviour

- `POST /scan-so/warm` is fired on modal open / screen mount
  (`ScanOrderModal.tsx:304`, `MobileScan.tsx:470`) so the cached catalog prompt
  prefix is warm before the operator finishes photographing.
- After enqueue the client holds nothing: the job row is the durable state. Both
  surfaces poll `GET /scan-so/jobs?salesperson=` (latest 20) and show today's
  jobs first (`MobileScan.tsx:135-140`, `ScanOrderModal.tsx:308-320`).
- The operator can close the app. That is the entire point of the background
  path — the pre-0067 flow had the phone awaiting `/extract` and then POSTing the
  DRAFT itself, so closing the app killed the order
  (`backend/src/db/migrations-pg/0067_scm_scan_jobs.sql:3-9`).
- Completion is delivered as a **private announcement** to the rep who scanned —
  see [`announcements.md`](./announcements.md) and §3 below.

## 2. API surface

Mounted at `backend/src/scm/index.ts:516-517`:

```
scm.use("/scan-so/*", scmAreaGuard("scm.sales.orders", { writeLevel: "view" }));
scm.route("/scan-so", scanSo);
```

plus `scanSo.use('*', supabaseAuth)` (`scan-so.ts:99`). Full public prefix is
`/api/scm/scan-so/*`.

| Method | Path | Line | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/enqueue` | `:4172` | multipart slip + receipt photos → durable job → `202 { job_id, status:"queued" }` |
| GET | `/jobs` | `:4610` | latest 20 jobs, optional `?salesperson=`; also runs the stale-job reaper |
| GET | `/jobs/:id` | `:4639` | poll one job; also runs the reaper |
| POST | `/jobs/clear-failed` | `:4677` | delete the caller's `status='error'` rows (`*` clears every rep's) |
| POST | `/extract` | `:2967` | the blocking client-driven path — kept as mobile's fallback |
| POST | `/samples/:id/confirm` | `:4718` | store the operator-reviewed JSON; triggers the distillers |
| GET | `/salespeople` | `:2269` | distinct reps across samples + rules (the modal datalist) |
| GET | `/rules/:salesperson` | `:2302` | view a rep's distilled rules |
| POST | `/rules/:salesperson/distill` | `:2325` | manually regenerate a rep's rules |
| GET | `/slip-image` | `:2345` | stream a stored slip photo |
| POST | `/warm` | `:2376` | pre-warm the cached catalog prompt prefix |

Note `/rules/:salesperson` and `/rules/:salesperson/distill` carry **no check
beyond the area guard** (`:2302`, `:2325`): any admitted caller can read any
rep's distilled rules, and can trigger a **billed Anthropic distill** for any
rep, with no rate limit. `/slip-image` (`:2345`) guards only that the key starts
with `scan-slips/` (`:2347`) — knowing a sample id returns the customer's slip
photo.

The sibling `POST /api/scm/scan-payment/extract`
(`backend/src/scm/routes/scan-payment.ts`, mounted `scm/index.ts:526-527`)
reads a card-terminal / EPP receipt into a payment row. It is
**extraction-only — no samples, no learning** (`scm/index.ts:525`).

## 3. Backend — the background pipeline

`backend/src/scm/routes/scan-so.ts` (4,815 lines). Model `claude-sonnet-4-6`
(`:101`), endpoint `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` (`:102`), retried on
429/500/502/503/529 with backoff (`anthropicFetchWithRetry`, `:113-120`).
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is **optional** on the Env — absent, `/extract` returns
`503 anthropic_key_missing` rather than breaking the Worker (`:64-67`).

### enqueue → job → DRAFT

1. **`POST /enqueue`** (`:4172`) parses the multipart upload, normalises the rep
   key, runs the duplicate probe, writes the photos to R2 under
   `scan-jobs/{jobId}/{n}`, inserts the `scm.scan_jobs` row, then dispatches.
2. **Dispatch** (`:4317-4344`) — the pipeline **is a Cloudflare Queue job**, not
   `waitUntil`:
   ```
   if (c.env.SCAN_QUEUE) { await c.env.SCAN_QUEUE.send({ jobId }); }
   else { c.executionCtx.waitUntil(runScanJob(...)); }
   ```
   The message carries only the job id; the consumer rebuilds everything from the
   row and the R2 photos. `waitUntil` remains only as a fallback for a runtime
   with `SCAN_QUEUE` unbound (older deploy, tests).
   > The long comment block at `scan-so.ts:3105-3140` still describes the
   > pipeline as running "inside ctx.waitUntil". That header is **stale** — read
   > `:4308-4344` and `backend/wrangler.toml:124-139` for what actually runs.
3. **Consumer** — `backend/src/index.ts:566-580`, queue `houzs-scan-ocr`, DLQ
   `houzs-scan-ocr-dlq`, `max_batch_size = 1`, `max_retries = 3`
   (`backend/wrangler.toml:131-139`). Success `ack()`, failure `retry()`. The move
   off `waitUntil` was a reliability fix: Cloudflare evicts the isolate on the
   60-110s real-slip OCR calls, which left jobs stuck `running` forever
   (`wrangler.toml:124-129`, `index.ts:560-565`).
4. **`runScanJob`** (`:3872`) calls the *same functions* `/extract` uses — not
   copies: `loadCatalog`, `buildCachedPrefix`, `loadPromptInjections`,
   `callClaudeSlipExtract`, `insertScanSample`, `storeScanImages`,
   `postProcessSlip` (`:3136-3139`).
5. **DRAFT create** goes through `createDraftSalesOrder` imported from
   `./mfg-sales-orders` (`scan-so.ts:80`) — the factored, pricing-critical create
   core, never reimplemented here. Each scanned receipt becomes a payments-ledger
   row through `recordSoPaymentRow`, the same factored insert+audit core the
   interactive payments route uses.
6. **Reaper** — `SCAN_JOB_STALE_MINUTES = 3` (`:4375`). A job stuck
   `queued`/`running` past 3 minutes is re-run once from its durable R2 photos
   (`retry_count` 0 → 1, migration 0070) and only errored after that single retry
   is spent. 3 rather than 10 because `/extract` carries a 110s abort, so past 3
   minutes the job is a deploy/isolate-killed zombie, not a slow-but-alive call
   (`:4370-4374`). The reaper rides the poll endpoints (`:4613`, `:4643`), so a
   client polling is what advances a stranded job; the claim is conditional so
   concurrent polls cannot double-run it.
7. **Notice** — `postScanNotice` (`:3568-3588`) delegates to
   `postPersonalNotice` (`backend/src/services/personalNotice.ts`) with
   `source:'scan'` and a 7-day expiry, targeting the single `houzs_user_id`
   captured at enqueue. Fail-soft: a notice insert must never fail the scan job.

### Address correction

Google Geocoding lives in this file, not in a maps module: `geocodeAddress`
(`:187`), gated on `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`. When it resolves, its state / city /
postcode are **preferred over** the model's parse, because the LLM mis-parses
Malaysian addresses; **postcode is the driver** (`:222`, and
`docs/ocr-payment-spec.md` §4). When the key is unset the model's parse is left
untouched. The geocoded state is seeded into `addressStateMatch` so the
never-invent validator can check it against the live locality list (`:2911-2916`).

### Duplicate handling — warn, never block

Migration `0068_scan_dedup.sql` documents the two rules: **A (image)** — the same
photo SHA-256 as a sample from the last 30 days whose job already minted an SO;
**B (content)** — a non-cancelled SO with the same normalised phone AND (same
customer SO ref, or same slip date + same grand total). A suspected duplicate
**still creates the DRAFT**; the note is prefixed `POSSIBLE DUPLICATE of <doc_no>`
and `scan_jobs.duplicate_of` carries the original. Owner ruling, quoted at
`scan-so.ts:4193-4197`: this was already opened, whether to open it again is the
person's decision. The client re-sends the identical upload with `force=1` after
the operator confirms.

---

## 4. The learning loop — the part people get wrong

### One table, four statuses, two consumers that want opposite things

`scm.so_scan_samples.status` is free text (no CHECK constraint, so the vocabulary
needed no migration). The authoritative explanation is the block at
`scan-so.ts:1658-1682`:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `EXTRACTED` | the AI read it; no human has reviewed it |
| `CONFIRMED` | the operator reviewed **and changed something** — `corrected` and `extracted` DIFFER, so the pair carries a teachable diff |
| `ACCEPTED` | the operator reviewed and took the extraction **as-is**. Ground truth, but **no diff** |
| `FAILED` | the extraction itself errored |

Note the vocabulary trap: the constant for "corrected" is
`SAMPLE_CORRECTED = 'CONFIRMED'` (`:1682`). The stored string says CONFIRMED; it
means *corrected*.

The split exists because the two consumers want opposite things:

- **The distillers MINE THE DIFF.** "Wherever they differ, the AI misread." A
  zero-diff pair teaches them nothing, and inside their `LIMIT` window it would
  push a real correction out of the pool. They read `status = CONFIRMED` only —
  `:1875`, `:1998`, `:2108`, `:2220`.
- **The few-shot pool shows the model GOOD OUTPUT.** There both outcomes are
  equally true, and corrected-only was a **biased sample of the AI's own
  failures**: while the edit-gate was the only writer, the pool could contain
  only slips the AI got wrong. It reads both, ranked corrected-first
  (`:2598`, `:2605-2626`).

**So: a zero-diff confirm teaches the DISTILLERS nothing, but it does still
teach the few-shot pool.** That is the precise statement. The confirm handler
short-circuits explicitly rather than spending Anthropic calls to regenerate
identical rules from an unchanged pool (`:4770-4773`).

### "The diff" means three different things — none of them is a structural differ

There is **no TypeScript function anywhere that computes an
`extracted` ↔ `corrected` diff.** What exists is:

1. **A label-computing comparison, in the frontend.** `maybeLearnFromScan`
   (`SalesOrderNew.tsx:1216-1324`, mobile twin `MobileNewSO.tsx:1327-1395`) walks
   a fixed field list — customer name, address parts, `customerSoRef`, customer
   and building type, the four payment matches, line count, per-line `itemCode` —
   with `const mark = (a, b) => { if (a !== b) changed = true }` (`:1235-1236`),
   and sends `accepted: !changed` (`:1322`). The comment at `:1230-1234` is
   explicit that this is **no longer a gate — it is the sample's LABEL**.
2. **The rule-deriving diff, done by the model.** The pairs are serialised by
   `pairExamplesText` (`scan-so.ts:1776-1790`, each side truncated) and the
   meta-prompt instructs the model to derive the rules: *"DERIVE THE RULES FROM
   THE DIFFS: compare each 'AI extracted' JSON against its 'Operator corrected'
   JSON"* (`:1733`; alias version `:1949`, global-rules version `:2060`).
3. **A "was it edited at all" check, in the backend.** `scan-sample-review.ts:95-102`
   asks `mfg_so_audit_log` for any row whose action is not in
   `("CREATE","UPDATE_STATUS")`. This is a boolean, not a diff.

### How a correction is captured

Two paths write a sample review, and both land in the same pool:

1. **Interactive** — the operator reviews inside the New SO form (desktop or
   mobile) and the form POSTs `/scan-so/samples/:id/confirm` on save
   (`:4718`). `accepted: true` in the body means "I changed nothing" → status
   `ACCEPTED`; absent/false → `CONFIRMED`.
2. **Background** — nothing confirms the sample, because the operator's review is
   the DRAFT they open later. `backend/src/scm/lib/scan-sample-review.ts`
   (`noteScanDraftAccepted`, `:63-126`) listens to the **DRAFT → CONFIRMED status
   transition** on the SO and, if the operator changed nothing, promotes the
   sample `EXTRACTED → ACCEPTED` with `corrected = extracted`. Before this module
   existed the main scan route fed the loop **nothing** (`scan-sample-review.ts:1-12`).

Two guards worth knowing:

- **Only the accepted-as-is case is captured on the background path.** If the
  operator *edited* the draft, the honest `corrected` blob would require reversing
  the lossy slip → SO mapper (itemGroup collapsed to `others`, dates nulled,
  rawText folded into the line remark). Writing `corrected = extracted` for an
  edited draft would assert "the AI read this correctly" about a reading a human
  had just fixed — teaching the model to repeat the mistake *and* displacing a
  real correction from the distill window. A wrong pair is worse than no pair, so
  an edited draft is left alone (`scan-sample-review.ts:19-28`).
- **No downgrade.** An `ACCEPTED` write can never bury a sample already
  `CONFIRMED` (`:4753`); the reverse is an upgrade and rides through. Edit
  detection reads `mfg_so_audit_log`, excluding only `CREATE` and `UPDATE_STATUS`
  by name so that a mutation action added later counts as an edit by default —
  and `source IS NULL` counts as an edit, because unknown provenance must fail
  toward *not* learning (`scan-sample-review.ts:44-49`, `:90-101`).

### There is no live UI path that produces a `CONFIRMED` sample

Read this before you plan work on the learning loop. Every claim here was
grepped repo-wide at `8f8427ed`.

`POST /scan-so/samples/:id/confirm` has exactly **two** callers —
`frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/SalesOrderNew.tsx:1320` and
`frontend/src/mobile/MobileNewSO.tsx:1392` — and both are gated on the same
guard, `if (!fromScan || !scanSampleId || !scanAiOriginal) return;`
(`SalesOrderNew.tsx:1217`, `MobileNewSO.tsx:1327`). Neither gate can open today:

- **Desktop.** `fromScan` is `searchParams.get('fromScan') === '1'`
  (`SalesOrderNew.tsx:374`), and the prefill is read from
  `sessionStorage[SCAN_PREFILL_KEY]` (`:389`). Nothing navigates with
  `?fromScan=1` — the string appears only inside `SalesOrderNew.tsx` itself — and
  nothing **writes** `SCAN_PREFILL_KEY`: the only four hits repo-wide are the
  export (`ScanOrderModal.tsx:88`), the import, the read and the removal.
  `ScanOrderModal` stopped calling `/extract` when it became a pure enqueue
  surface (`ScanOrderModal.tsx:174`), and the prefill writer went with it.
- **Mobile.** `fromScan = !!scanPrefill` (`MobileNewSO.tsx:838`), and
  `scanPrefill` arrives as a screen prop (`MobileApp.tsx:74`, `:641`). The only
  two `setScreen({ t: "new-so", ... })` call sites are `MobileApp.tsx:611`
  (`mode:"edit"`) and `:749` (`mode:"new"`); neither supplies it. MobileScan
  instead calls the **headless** `createDraftFromPrefill`
  (`MobileNewSO.tsx:415`, its only caller is `MobileScan.tsx:826`), which POSTs
  `/mfg-sales-orders` and nothing else (`MobileNewSO.tsx:464-476`).

So the only live writer into the learning pool is `noteScanDraftAccepted`, and
it writes **`ACCEPTED` only** — it deliberately refuses to write anything for an
edited draft. Every distiller filters `status = 'CONFIRMED'`. **Net: no new
operator correction can enter any distill pool through the shipped UI.** The
distillers still run and still work; they re-chew whatever `CONFIRMED` rows
already exist. The few-shot pool, which accepts `ACCEPTED`, does keep growing.

> Unverifiable from the tree: whether any `CONFIRMED` rows exist in the live DB.
> That is runtime data.
>
> This is a stated observation, not a bug report — do not file it as one without
> checking with the owner whether the enqueue-only modal was the intended end
> state. `08975b9d feat(scan): feed the OCR learning loop from the path that
> actually runs (#656)` is the commit that added `noteScanDraftAccepted`, so the
> gap was at least partly known.

### The rule layers that exist in code today

All three live in **one table**, `scm.so_scan_rules`, keyed by `salesperson`;
two keys are reserved. No migration was needed for either reserved row.

| Layer | Storage key | Distiller | Pool it mines |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Per-salesperson rules** | the rep's normalised name | `distillSalespersonRules` | that rep's latest ≤50 `CONFIRMED` samples |
| **Global alias dictionary** | `'__GLOBAL__'` (`:1716`) | `distillGlobalAliases` (`:1972`) | latest ≤80 `CONFIRMED` samples across all reps |
| **Global shared rules** | `'__GLOBAL_RULES__'` (`:1723`) | `distillGlobalRules` (`:2058`) | `CONFIRMED` corrections across all reps |

`isGlobalKey()` (`:1726`) keeps both reserved rows out of the salesperson
datalist, the per-rep enumeration and the weekly per-rep pass.

Per-rep rules are organised by product category (SOFA / MATTRESS / BEDFRAME /
ACCESSORY / SERVICE / GENERAL) because a rep's notation differs between slip
types (`:1685-1690`). `__GLOBAL__` holds product-name and fabric-code **aliases**
("Bamboo Cruise" / "Cruise" / "B.Cruise" → one SKU). `__GLOBAL_RULES__` holds
the common, rep-independent **extraction patterns** — how the operator
consistently fixes sizes, fabric-code casing, payment-note mapping, address
splitting, `customerSoRef` shape — so one rep's corrections raise the baseline
for everyone including a brand-new rep with no rules of their own
(`:2046-2057`).

### When the distillers run

- **On every confirm**, fire-and-forget in `waitUntil` (`:4775-4812`): the rep's
  rules, then `__GLOBAL__`, then `__GLOBAL_RULES__` — sequential, to keep it to
  one Anthropic call at a time. Each cheap-skips below its sample threshold
  (2 for the rep, 3 for the global rules) without an API call, so firing on every
  confirm is safe. Never blocks the confirm. This is the primary fast path.
- **Weekly**, Sunday-gated inside the daily 02:00 UTC cron slot
  (`backend/src/index.ts:536-545`) — `distillAllSalespersonRules` rebuilds every
  rep plus both global rows in bulk. There is deliberately **no dedicated cron
  trigger**; adding one would double-run a Claude-API-billed distill every week
  (`scm/index.ts:503-509`).
- **Manually**, `POST /scan-so/rules/:salesperson/distill` (`:2325`).

### Where the layers are injected

`loadPromptInjections` (`:2485`) builds four blocks, and they are appended to the
message in this order (`:2717-2720`):

```
globalAliasText → globalRulesText → repRulesText → fewShotText
```

All four sit **after** the `cache_control` boundary so the SYSTEM_PROMPT +
catalog prefix stays byte-stable across reps and across distills. The prefix is
cached with **`ttl: '1h'`** under the `anthropic-beta:
extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11` header (`:2698`, `:2711`) — the default 5-minute
ephemeral cache was extended because Houzs is a retailer and the injected
catalog is large (1,141 SKUs + 705 fabrics), so the default expired between
scans spaced apart (`:2693-2697`).

> **Divergence from the design doc.** `docs/ocr-self-evolution.md:18` states
> "Injection order in the prompt = **personal first, then global**". The code
> does the opposite — global aliases, then global rules, then the per-rep block,
> whose own comment says it is placed last so "a rep's own rules can still refine
> on top" (`:2514-2517`). Every block's prompt text also says it "complements,
> never overrides" the universal rules and the catalog. Whether the shipped order
> honours the owner's intent is a judgement call, but the literal ordering in the
> doc is **not** what runs.

## 5. What `docs/ocr-self-evolution.md` describes vs what is in the tree

That document is dated 2026-06-24 and mixes an owner vision with a build log.
Audited feature by feature at `8f8427ed`:

| Feature described | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Per-salesperson auto-distilled rules | **SHIPPED** | `distillSalespersonRules`, per-rep `so_scan_rules` row |
| Global alias dictionary | **SHIPPED** | `'__GLOBAL__'`, `scan-so.ts:1716`, `:1972` |
| Global shared rules layer (cross-rep distill + store + inject for every rep) | **SHIPPED** | `'__GLOBAL_RULES__'`, `:1723`, `:2058`, injected `:2718` |
| Fire-and-forget distill on confirm | **SHIPPED** | `:4775-4812` |
| Weekly Sunday cron rebuild | **SHIPPED** | `backend/src/index.ts:536-545` |
| `/samples/:id/confirm` is "edit-gated: only when actually edited" | **STALE.** The edit gate was deliberately removed; confirm now always fires and `accepted` is a **label**, not a gate (`SalesOrderNew.tsx:1230-1234`; vocabulary `scan-so.ts:1658-1682`) — and see the reachability note in §4 |
| Injection order "personal first, then global" | **NOT AS DESCRIBED** — code injects global before per-rep | `:2717-2720` |
| **Manual technique upload** — a rep types their own quirks ("my K = King", "my 7 has a slash") | **NOT FOUND IN CODE** | grep for `manual_rules` / `manualRules` / `so_scan_manual` over `backend/src` and `frontend/src` returns nothing |
| A `so_scan_manual_rules` table, or a manual-rules column on `so_scan_rules` | **NOT FOUND** | `so_scan_rules` is `(salesperson, rules, sample_count, updated_at)` — `0023_so_scan_samples.sql`; no later migration adds a column |
| "Teach the scanner your writing quirks" editor UI | **NOT FOUND** | no such surface in `frontend/src` |
| Owner promoting an individual tip to the global layer | **NOT FOUND** | the global rows are written only by the distillers |

Net: **both automatic engines ship; the entire "active upload" wave — the
manual, human-authored half of the personal layer — does not exist.** A rep can
today only teach the scanner by correcting it.

Two sibling documents:

- **`docs/ocr-prompt-audit.md`** (2026-06-24) is a read-only prompt audit. Its
  inventory says "4 live prompts" and lists **three** in scan-so;
  `buildGlobalRulesMetaPrompt` (`:2058`) shipped afterwards, so the real count is
  4 in scan-so + 1 in scan-payment. Its borrow-list has since been worked
  through: **B1** (multi-digit number guard) is in the prompt at `:852`, **B2**
  (ambiguity → lower confidence, do not guess) at `:850`, **B3** and **B4** in
  `scan-payment.ts:182`, `:192`, `:203`, **B5** (richer distiller checklist,
  including the "quirks that CONFLICT" cue) at `:1751`, `:1755`. **B6** shipped
  *differently* from the proposal: there is no `is_gold` column and no operator
  "mark as gold" control — the ranking is status-based (`goldFirst`,
  `:2595-2599`). **B7** (supplier-doc OCR) does not exist. Its §C
  ("upstream changes that are traps") is still current and is the thing to read
  before touching the prompt.
- **`docs/ocr-payment-spec.md`** covers the sibling `scan-payment` receipt OCR,
  the 3-method model, the processing/delivery date coupling and the
  postcode-driven address rule. One divergence worth knowing: §3 specifies
  `Processing = max(today, Delivery − 6 weeks)`, but the code pins
  `scanProcDate = scanDelivDate ? scanToday : null` (`scan-so.ts:3803-3806`) —
  Processing is always **today**, never Delivery minus six weeks, and no 42-day
  arithmetic exists in the file. The comment at `:3795-3797` records this as a
  deliberate owner ruling of 2026-07-04 superseding the spec. The both-or-neither
  half of the rule *is* honoured.

## 6. Database

All in the `scm` schema. Postgres-only — SCM has no D1 twin, so there is no
mirror file in `backend/src/db/migrations/`.

| Migration | Effect |
|---|---|
| `0023_so_scan_samples.sql` | `scm.so_scan_samples` + `scm.so_scan_rules` + 2 partial indexes |
| `0033_so_scan_slip_image.sql` | slip image key on the sample |
| `0034_so_scan_receipt_image.sql` | receipt image key on the sample |
| `0067_scm_scan_jobs.sql` | `scm.scan_jobs` + `created_at` / `salesperson` indexes |
| `0068_scan_dedup.sql` | `scan_jobs.duplicate_of` + 3 lookup indexes (`so_scan_samples(image_sha256)`, `scan_jobs(sample_id)`, `mfg_sales_orders(phone)`) |
| `0070_scan_jobs_retry_count.sql` | `retry_count` — the reaper's single-retry budget |
| `0141_scan_jobs_receipt_image_keys.sql` | `receipt_image_keys jsonb` — the audit manifest of which uploads the model classified as receipts |

**`scm.so_scan_samples`** — `id uuid`, `created_at`, `image_sha256` (SHA-256 of
the first upload, for dedupe), `salesperson`, `extracted jsonb`,
`corrected jsonb`, `status text DEFAULT 'EXTRACTED'`. Both indexes are
**partial, `WHERE corrected IS NOT NULL`**: `(created_at DESC)` and
`(salesperson, created_at DESC)` — exactly the two reads the few-shot pool and
the distillers make.

**`scm.so_scan_rules`** — `salesperson text PRIMARY KEY`, `rules text NOT NULL`,
`sample_count int`, `updated_at`. One row per rep plus the two reserved rows.

**`scm.scan_jobs`** — `id uuid`, `status` (`queued|running|done|error`),
`salesperson` (normalised; reads use `ilike`), `salesperson_id uuid`
(scm.staff, replayed as the SO's `created_by`), `houzs_user_id bigint` (drives
the venue-by-active-project auto-fill *and* is the notice target),
`image_keys jsonb`, `receipt_image_keys jsonb`, `sample_id uuid`, `so_doc_no`,
`error` (a short plain-language sentence, never a raw exception),
`duplicate_of`, `retry_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

Known gap, flagged in code: `scan_jobs.so_doc_no` is **not indexed**
(`scan-sample-review.ts:66-73`). `noteScanDraftAccepted` is the only lookup
travelling that direction and it fires only on DRAFT → CONFIRMED, so it is fine
at today's volume — but an index on `so_doc_no` is the right follow-up, and it
needs a staging-first migration.

The completion notice writes to **`public.announcements`** via the D1-compat
Postgres shim (`personalNotice.ts:94-111`), not to any scm table.

## 7. Who can see / do what, and where it is enforced

| Actor | Can | Enforced at |
|---|---|---|
| Unauthenticated | nothing | `/api/*` auth wall, then `supabaseAuth` on every route (`scan-so.ts:99`) |
| Any signed-in user whose position holds **at least `view`** on `scm.sales.orders` | scan: `warm`, `enqueue`, `extract`, `slip-upload`, poll jobs, confirm samples | `scm/index.ts:516` — `scmAreaGuard("scm.sales.orders", { writeLevel: "view" })` |
| Owner / `*` | everything, plus `clear-failed` across every rep | `area-guard.ts:122-126` (wildcard bypass); `scan-so.ts:4681-4683` |
| A rep | clear only their **own** failed job rows | `scan-so.ts:4693` — `ilike` on the caller's normalised name, taken from `user_metadata.name` |

`writeLevel: 'view'` is deliberate and dated 2026-07-04 (`scm/index.ts:510-515`):
these POSTs only stage uploads and background OCR producing the **caller's own**
draft — the salesperson uuid is stamped from the caller — and never mutate an
existing SO. Requiring `edit` 403'd every view-level rep (Sales Executive) on the
mobile Scan flow. The actual SO create/edit routes keep the default `edit` gate.

Salesperson attribution on write is **not** caller-trusted: the draft's staff id
comes from `resolveScanUploaderStaffId` on the authed request (`:4146-4166`,
called `:4222-4223`), never from the request body.

Read scope, on the other hand, is thin. Above the area guard there is **no
per-user check anywhere in this router**:

- `GET /scan-so/jobs` is scoped by **company only** (`:4623` —
  `.eq('company_id', activeCompanyId(c))`). `?salesperson=` is a filter the
  client chooses, not a gate; omit it and you get the latest 20 jobs of the whole
  company.
- `GET /scan-so/jobs/:id` has **no company filter and no owner filter**
  (`:4648-4655`) — a known job id resolves for any admitted caller,
  cross-company.
- `GET /scan-so/slip-image?key=` guards only the `scan-slips/` prefix (`:2347`),
  so a known sample id returns the customer's slip photo.
- `GET /scan-so/rules/:salesperson` returns any rep's distilled rules, and
  `POST /scan-so/rules/:salesperson/distill` triggers a billed Anthropic call for
  any rep — neither has an owner or admin check (`:2302`, `:2325`).
- `POST /scan-so/samples/:id/confirm` overwrites any sample's `corrected` blob
  and label with no ownership check (`:4718`). It has no live UI caller today
  (see §4) but the endpoint is live.

None of this leaks order *content* through the jobs endpoints (the payload is
status / doc-no / error / image keys), but do not assume per-rep or
cross-company isolation here.

### Desktop and mobile files that must change together

| Change | Desktop | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| Job shape, poll normalisation, time predicates | **`vendor/scm/lib/scan-jobs.ts`** — shared; edit once | |
| OCR result → New SO form mapping | **`vendor/scm/lib/scan-prefill.ts`** — shared; this is where the two surfaces previously diverged | |
| Image compression before upload | **`vendor/shared/image-compress.ts`** — shared (`compressForOcr` / `compressAllForOcr`) | |
| Upload / capture UX, batch handling, duplicate confirm | `vendor/scm/components/ScanOrderModal.tsx` | `mobile/MobileScan.tsx` |
| The sample-labelling comparison (`maybeLearnFromScan`) | `pages/scm-v2/SalesOrderNew.tsx:1216-1324` | `mobile/MobileNewSO.tsx:1327-1395` — **two copies of one rule**; keep them in step |
| Draft-landed notification | `pages/scm-v2/MfgSalesOrdersListV2.tsx` (none today) | `mobile/MobileSalesOrders.tsx:270-340` |
| The `ExtractedSlip` type | declared in `ScanOrderModal.tsx`, imported by `scan-prefill.ts:34` — a desktop file the mobile path depends on | |
| Anything server-side (prompt, rules, pipeline) | `backend/src/scm/routes/scan-so.ts` — one implementation, both shells | |

## 8. Performance summary

### Timeouts and retries

| Layer | Value | Cite |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic extract call | `AbortSignal.timeout(110_000)` — bounds the **whole retry window**, not each attempt | `scan-so.ts:2684-2688` |
| Anthropic distill call | **no explicit timeout** | `claudeDistillCall` `:1792-1836` |
| Google Geocoding | `AbortSignal.timeout(8_000)`, fail-soft to null | `:197` |
| Frontend fetch | 120s for any `/scan-` path, 30s otherwise | `frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/authed-fetch.ts:64-66` |
| Transport retry | 3 tries on 429/500/502/503/529 | `:111-120` |
| Queue | `max_retries = 3`, then DLQ | `backend/wrangler.toml:135-139` |
| Reaper | 3 min → one re-run from R2 → terminal error | `:4375-4376` |
| Job poll | both clients poll `/jobs` every 4s while a job is unsettled, `false` when settled | `ScanOrderModal.tsx:323-328`, `MobileScan.tsx:536-537` |

### Sizes

- Server cap `MAX_FILE_BYTES = 20 MB` per file (`:100`, enforced `:2430`).
- **Client pre-compression is the load-bearing one**: 2000px long edge, JPEG
  q0.85 (`frontend/src/vendor/shared/image-compress.ts:38`, `:68`). Its header
  carries the measured figure — *2000px @ q0.85 lands ~400-700KB* — against
  Anthropic's 1568px effective cap and 5 MB per-image API limit. The 20 MB gate
  was roughly 2.7× the model's per-image cap before this landed.
  `frontend/src/lib/imagePipeline.ts:28` explicitly forbids wiring the generic
  image pipeline into the scan paths.
- `max_tokens` 8192 extract (`:2702`), 2048 distill (`:1806`). Distilled rules
  soft-capped at 32,000 chars (`:1907`). Distill windows: 50 samples per rep
  (`:1878`), 80 global (`:2001`, `:2110`). Few-shot pool: 5, from a 15-row fetch.

### Caching

- Cached prefix `ttl: '1h'` under `anthropic-beta:
  extended-cache-ttl-2025-04-11` (`:2698`, `:2711`) — extended from the 5-minute
  default because the catalog is large (1,141 SKUs + 705 fabrics, `:2694`). Hit
  rate is observable from `usage.cache_read_input_tokens` /
  `cache_creation_input_tokens` (`:2748-2749`).
- `POST /warm` on modal/screen open, plus a business-hours keep-warm cron
  (`backend/src/index.ts:427-439`, UTC 00-13 ≈ MYT 08:00-22:00).
- **Cheap-skip distillers** — below their sample threshold (2 per rep, 3 for the
  global rules) they return without an API call, which is what makes firing on
  every confirm affordable.
- Partial indexes on `so_scan_samples` matched exactly to the two learning reads.

### Watch

- The distillers are sequential on the confirm path (three Anthropic calls, one
  at a time) inside `waitUntil` — a Worker eviction loses that regeneration. The
  weekly cron is the backstop.
- `scan_jobs.so_doc_no` unindexed (see §6).
- Both poll endpoints run the stale-job reaper on **every** call, so reaper cost
  scales with the number of open Scan screens.
- Test coverage is thin: `backend/tests/scanReceiptPlan.test.ts` is the only scan
  test, and `e2e/specs/` has no scan spec.

The only measured numbers in the tree are the compression figure above and the
catalog size. The "60-110s real-slip OCR calls" range quoted throughout comes
from `wrangler.toml:124-129` and `scan-so.ts:4312` — statements in comments, not
a benchmark. **No end-to-end latency or accuracy benchmark for this module exists
anywhere in `docs/`.**
