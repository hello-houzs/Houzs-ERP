# Module: Delivery / TMS

Per-module technical doc — the delivery board (Pending Delivery / Pending
Schedule / Overdue / Delivered), the region model, and Driver / Helper / Lorry
assignment. Third of the per-module set (see `docs/modules/sales-order.md` for
the shape).

Verified against `main` @ `8f8427ed`. Line citations are that commit.

## 1. Frontend

### Screens
| Surface | File | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Desktop board | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryPlanning.tsx` | 1,377 lines. Component at `:517`. The 4 state tabs + region chips + inline Driver / Lorry cells. |
| Desktop trips | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/Trips.tsx:43` | A trip = one lorry-day with an ordered stop list. |
| Desktop fleet masters | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/Fleet.tsx:78` | `DriversSection` `:98`, `HelpersSection` `:294`, `LorriesSection` `:461`; `LorryDetail.tsx:71` mounts as a drawer from `Fleet.tsx:613`. |
| Desktop regions | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryPlanningRegions.tsx:40` | Region master + per-state mapping editor. |
| Desktop capacity | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/LorryCapacity.tsx:140` | |
| Mobile run-sheet | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:277` | 2,408 lines. Driver job-card run sheet. |
| Mobile POD | `frontend/src/mobile/MobilePOD.tsx:71` | Photo / signature capture. |
| Mobile masters | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` | Generic list configs: `drivers` `:1327`, `helpers` `:1357`, `fleet` (lorries) `:1857`, `delivery-planning-regions` `:1957`. |
| Board drawers | `frontend/src/vendor/scm/components/DeliveryFieldsDrawer.tsx:46`, `NewDpOrderDrawer.tsx:45`, `ScheduleDpOrderDrawer.tsx:40` | HC field editing, manual DP-order create, DP scheduling. |

`frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/Drivers.tsx:22` is on disk with **no importer** —
the `/scm/drivers` route was retired on 2026-07-17 in favour of the Drivers
section of `/scm/fleet` (`App.tsx:593-599`, `Sidebar.tsx:518-523`). Do not
re-add it.

### The four state tabs

`DELIVERY_STATES` (`frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/delivery-planning-queries.ts:19-21`)
with labels at `:24-29`; re-exported as `STATE_TABS` in the page
(`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:192`) and rendered with an "All" tab prepended at
`:1148-1151`.

| Tab | `delivery_state` | Means |
|---|---|---|
| Pending Delivery | `PENDING_DELIVERY` | Goods not ready, and more than 3 days from the effective delivery date |
| Pending Schedule | `PENDING_SCHEDULE` | Ready to ship, not yet fully delivered |
| Overdue | `OVERDUE` | Not ready AND within 3 days of (or past) the effective delivery date |
| Delivered | `DELIVERED` | Status `DELIVERED`, or every deliverable line remaining is 0 once any qty shipped |

**Mobile does NOT use these tabs.** `MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:143-148` uses
Today / Tomorrow / History day buckets, split client-side off the effective
delivery date (`:297-330`); the four states survive only as the `Bucket` type
(`:64`) that colours the pill. Anything further out than tomorrow and not
delivered is deliberately off the driver run-sheet — the desktop board owns
long-range planning (`:33-42`).

### Data hooks

All in `frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/`:

| Hook | File:line | Query key | staleTime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `useDeliveryPlanning` | `delivery-planning-queries.ts:151` | `['delivery-planning', region, state]` | 30 s, `placeholderData: prev` (`:165-166`) |
| `useDeliveryPlanningLines` | `:195` | `['delivery-planning','lines',docNo]` | 30 s, lazy (`enabled: !!docNo`) |
| `useScheduleDelivery` | `:397` | optimistic write over `['delivery-planning']` (`:416-417`), `onSettled` invalidate (`:462`) | — |
| `useUpdateDeliveryFields` | `:247` | invalidates `['delivery-planning']` | — |
| `useCreateDpOrder` / `useCancelDpOrder` / `useScheduleDpOrder` | `:314` / `:324` / `:351` | last also invalidates `['scm-trips']`, `['scm-trip']` | — |
| `useConvertSosToDo` | `:494` | invalidates SO + DO + board keys (`:542-546`) | — |
| `useDrivers` / `useHelpers` / `useLorries` | `drivers-queries.ts:46` / `helpers-queries.ts:34` / `lorries-queries.ts:99` | `['drivers'\|'helpers'\|'lorries', …]` | 60 s |
| `useTrips` / `useTrip` | `trips-queries.ts:49` / `:65` | `['scm-trips', from,to,status]` / `['scm-trip', id]` | 30 s / 15 s |
| `useLorryCapacity` | `lorry-capacity-queries.ts:60` | `['lorry-capacity', from,to,fleet]` | 30 s |
| `useDeliveryPlanningRegions` / `useStateDeliveryRegions` | `delivery-planning-regions-queries.ts:53` / `:106` | `REGIONS_KEY` / `STATES_KEY` | 60 s / 30 s |

Mobile does **not** reuse `useDeliveryPlanning`. It runs its own query against
the same endpoint — `["mobile-delivery-planning","ALL"]`, `staleTime 30_000`,
always `?region=ALL&state=ALL` (`MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:290-294`), and
invalidates it plus the shared SO/DO/inventory keys after a status write
(`:1248-1249`).

Loading behaviour: the desktop board keeps the previous rows on screen while a
region/state tab switch loads (`placeholderData: prev`), and the Driver / Lorry
selects write optimistically (`useScheduleDelivery` `:416-417`) so a picked name
appears before the round-trip settles. Filters live in the URL
(`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:527-529`, `useSearchParams`) per the repo's "URL is
state" rule.

## 2. API surface

All under `/api/scm`. Mounted in `backend/src/scm/index.ts`; **every one of
these routers is gated by `scmAreaGuard('scm.transportation.drivers')`** — see
§6.

(rows for `/delivery-planning`, `/trips`, `/drivers`, `/helpers`, `/lorries`).

## 3. Backend

### How a job reaches the board — `delivery-planning.ts:409-1372`

The board is a **union of four sources**, assembled per request. Nothing is
materialised; there is no board table.

1. **Sales Orders** (`row_type: 'so'`, `:852`) — live `scm.mfg_sales_orders`
   with `status NOT IN (DRAFT, CANCELLED)` that carry a delivery-date signal
   (`customer_delivery_date` or `internal_expected_dd`), paginated so the
   1000-row PostgREST cap cannot silently truncate (`:442-479`). Their DOs,
   crew, readiness and warehouse labels are joined on.
2. **Service Cases** (`row_type: 'assr'`, `:1034`) — read from **`public.assr_cases`
   via `c.env.DB`** (`:981-1004`), not the scm client. A case appears only when
   it is open (`closed_at IS NULL AND archived_at IS NULL`) and carries a
   trigger date. **One row per SET date**, so a case can appear as up to three
   independent legs (`:1019-1027`): `customer_pickup_at` → `job_kind
   'customer_pickup'`, `inspection_visit_at` **when `inspection_by = 'own'`** →
   `'inspection'`, `do_date` → `'delivery'`. Row key is `<ASSR-NO>#<job_kind>`
   (`:1031`). ASSR rows always land as `PENDING_DELIVERY` (`:1046-1048`).
3. **DP Orders** (`row_type: 'dp'`, `:1150`) — manual jobs from `scm.dp_orders`
   with **no** source document (`so_doc_no`, `assr_case_id`, `do_id` all null)
   and status not DELIVERED/CANCELLED (`:1132-1136`). DP orders that DO have a
   source are deliberately excluded so the line is not doubled (`:1120-1124`).
4. **PMS Projects** (`row_type: 'project'`, `:1269`) — non-archived projects
   with a `setup_start_at` or `dismantle_start_at`, read from `public` via
   `c.env.DB` (`:1240-1244`). One row per window; crew is a **read-only mirror**
   of what Projects assigned (`:1330-1336`) — edit it in Projects, not here.

Each of the last three unions is wrapped defensively: a failure logs and leaves
the SO rows untouched (`:1341-1343`).

Then: row scope (§6) → region filter → counts → state filter →
`{ orders, counts, regions }` (`:1345-1371`). Counts are computed over the
**region-filtered** set BEFORE the state filter, so switching state tabs does
not move the badge numbers (`:1358-1364`).

### The 4-state derivation — `derivePlanningState`, `:283-308`

Pure, exported, and **shared with the `/mfg-sales-orders` list endpoint** so the
board and the mobile Orders card cannot drift (`:266-269`). A manual override
stored on the SO header (`delivery_state`) wins when it is one of the four enum
values (`:290`); otherwise:

```
DELIVERED        status DELIVERED, or delivered > 0 && remaining <= 0
PENDING_SCHEDULE readyToShip (isMainReady when a MAIN line exists, else isFullyReady)
OVERDUE          !readyToShip && daysLeft <= 3            (daysLeft vs the EFFECTIVE date)
PENDING_DELIVERY otherwise
```

Effective delivery date = `amended_delivery_date ?? customer_delivery_date`
(`:277-278`). The original customer date is never overwritten.
`backend/src/services/agents/delivery-agent.ts:53` imports this same function,
so the agent and the board cannot disagree.

### Region is derived from the customer STATE — verified

Confirmed at this commit. `stateToRegionsFromConfig()`
(`delivery-planning.ts:190-206`) takes `customer_state`, falls back to
`customer_country`, normalises it (`normState` `:107-114`: uppercase, strip
accents, punctuation → space, collapse whitespace, so "Pulau Pinang" /
"P.Pinang" / "pulau-pinang" all match), and looks it up in the config map. Call
site for SO rows (`:839-841`):

```ts
const stateRegions = stateToRegionsFromConfig(regionCfg, r.customer_state, r.customer_country);
const primaryRegion = stateRegions[0] ?? FALLBACK_DEFAULT_REGION;
const regionSet    = new Set<Region>(stateRegions);
```

emitted as `region` + `regions[]` at `:951-952`. The other three row types use
the **same** function: ASSR off the case `location` (`:1013`), DP off
`dp_orders.state` (`:1141`), projects off the project `state` (`:1254`).

**Postcode is never used for region.** `postcode` is selected (`:474`) and
emitted (`:917`) purely as an address display column. The frontend restates the
rule in its type comment (`delivery-planning-queries.ts:31-36`, `:122`) and the
page header comment (`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:186-188`).

A region is a **config-driven open string**, not a fixed union: the buckets come
from `scm.delivery_planning_regions` and the mapping from
`scm.state_delivery_regions`, loaded once per request by `loadRegionConfig()`
(`:130-184`). A state may map to several regions; an unmapped state falls back
to `KL` if configured, else the first active region (`:201-205`). When the
config tables are empty the hardcoded `FALLBACK_REGIONS` keeps today's five
tabs (`:98-103`): KL/SEL, Northern, Southern, East Coast, EM.

> Not the same thing: `routeRegion()` in `backend/src/services/autocount.ts:280-287`
> returns `WEST | EAST | SG | null` from the SO's address line 3 and
> `SalesLocation`. It belongs to the AutoCount ASSR sync
> (`services/pull.ts:61`, `routes/assr.ts:1267`) and has nothing to do with the
> delivery board's buckets.

### Driver / Helper / Lorry routing model

Three masters, one shared fleet across companies. `drivers.ts:31-34` and
`helpers.ts:23-31` are explicit: the roster is deliberately **not** company-scoped;
`company_id` on a fleet row is a created-by stamp, not an isolation boundary.

**Assignment happens in two places, and they are not the same mechanism:**

| Path | What it writes | Who calls it |
|---|---|---|
| `PATCH /delivery-planning/:type/:id/schedule` (`:1705`) | schedule date, optional `deliveryState` override, and `{lorryId, driverId, tripId?, tripDate?, warehouseId?}` → **finds or creates a `scm.trips` row** for (lorry, date) and adds a `trip_stops` DELIVERY row (`:1909-1946`). `is_outsourced` derives from the lorry's `is_internal` (`:1705-1712`); trip numbers are minted max+1 via `mintMonthlyDocNo` (`:1716-1722`). | The board's `DriverEditCell` (`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:305`) and `LorryEditCell` (`:340`), and the bulk apply (`:660-665`). |
| `PUT /delivery-orders-mfg/:id/crew` (`delivery-orders-mfg.ts:3314`) | the full `scm.delivery_order_crew` row — driver 1/2, **helper 1/2**, lorry, plus name/IC/contact/plate snapshots — and syncs `driver_id` / `driver_name` / `vehicle` onto the DO header (`:3412-3414`). | **Nobody, at this commit.** No frontend file references `/crew`. |

Consequences worth knowing before you touch this:

- **There is no helper assignment UI on the delivery board or on Trips.** The
  schedule payload has no helper field (`scheduleSchema` `:1642-1662`), the
  board renders no helper cell, and the mobile detail shows Driver + Helper
  **read-only** (`MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:1612-1613`). Helpers can be
  assigned only via `POST /trips` / `PATCH /trips/:id` (`trips.ts:164-173`
  accept `helper1Id` / `helper2Id`) — and `frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/trips-queries.ts`
  exports no create/update hook, so no UI reaches it either.
- Driver / Lorry cells are **name-matched, not id-linked**: the board row
  carries `crew.driver_1_name` / `crew.lorry_plate`, and the cell preselects by
  matching that string against the master list, keeping an off-list current
  value selectable so an existing assignment never silently blanks
  (`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:311-336`, `:345-366`).
- ASSR rows are **assignable** (PR #947): picking a lorry wires the leg onto a
  real trip via `scheduleAssrOntoTrip`, so a service visit consumes fleet
  capacity like an SO/DO delivery. The stop links back to its case through
  `scm.trip_stops.assr_case_id` (mig 0166), and the board re-reads the trip's
  crew on every load (the "ASSR crew echo") so the assignment survives a
  refresh. **DP** rows still show "not applicable" for Driver / Lorry
  (`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:307`, `:342`); project rows are read-only mirrors
  (`:309`, `:344`).
- **One leg = one stop.** A leg re-scheduled to another lorry or day resolves to
  a different trip, so the wiring deletes that leg's stops on every other trip
  (`assr_case_id` + `stop_type`, `trip_id` ≠ the new one). Without it the visit
  would be counted against both lorries by `/lorry-capacity`. The SO/DO path
  does **not** do this and can still leave a stop behind on a re-point — a known
  gap, recorded in `BUG-HISTORY.md` (2026-07-21).
- A crew-only edit (a lorry with no `scheduleDate`) skips the case's date write,
  so the ASSR branch checks the case **exists and is open** up front; a closed,
  archived or unknown case is a 404 and never mints a trip or a DP number.

**How a person becomes a driver or helper — two disconnected mechanisms.**
(1) Manual master CRUD (`POST /drivers`, `POST /helpers`), which creates a
fleet row with no link to `public.users`. (2) A `user_id` link on
`scm.drivers` / `scm.helpers` that `resolveDeliveryScope` reads
(`backend/src/scm/lib/deliveryScope.ts:131-132`) to decide row scope.

> **Unverified / gap.** The `user_id` link columns and the "internal staff →
> fleet row" sync that `deliveryScope.ts:24-28` describes are **not created by
> any migration in this repo** — `grep drivers backend/src/db/migrations-pg/`
> returns only `0015`, `0022`, `0053`, `0083`; `0066_scm_staff_user_sync.sql:9,22`
> refers to a "migration 0060" that is an unrelated file locally. The sync
> therefore lives outside this repo (the 2990 full-schema import; see the note
> at `drivers.ts:9`). On any database built from this repo's migrations alone,
> `resolveDeliveryScope` fails open to `mode: 'all'` (`deliveryScope.ts:146`).
> I could not verify the production state of those columns from the repo.

Separately, `backend/src/routes/fleet.ts:25-29` (`GET /api/fleet/staff`, gate
`requirePermissionOrSalesView("users.read")`) uses a **different** driver/helper
concept entirely — `public.roles.name IN ('Driver','Helper','Storekeeper')` over
`public.users`. It feeds the Projects / Logistics crew pickers, not the SCM
fleet. The mismatch is noted in `backend/src/routes/inbox.ts:236-246`.

## 4. Database

Schema `scm` unless stated. The board itself has no table — it is derived per
request (§3).

| Table | Role |
|---|---|
| `scm.mfg_sales_orders` | Board's primary source. `delivery_state` (the manual override cache, `0053:172`, indexed `:174`), `customer_state`, `customer_country`, `customer_delivery_date`, `amended_delivery_date` + `amend_date_from_customer` + `amend_reason` (`0053:192-194`), `internal_expected_dd`, `postcode`, `building_type`, HC context columns (`0053:178-181`) |
| `scm.delivery_orders` | `delivery_state` (`0053:173`); execution columns `time_range`, `time_confirmed`, `arrival_at`, `departure_at`, `shipout_date`, `customer_delivered_date`, `eta_arriving_port`, `delivery_substatus` (`0053:182-189`), `arrives_em_warehouse_date` (`0053:195`) |
| `scm.delivery_order_crew` | `0053:144-169`. `do_id` UNIQUE; `driver_1_id`/`driver_2_id` → `scm.drivers`, `helper_1_id`/`helper_2_id` → `scm.helpers`, `lorry_id` → `scm.lorries`, plus name/IC/contact/plate SNAPSHOTS and `assigned_at`/`assigned_by` |
| `scm.trips` | `0053:68-92`. `trip_no`, `trip_date`, `lorry_id`, `driver_id`, `helper_1_id`, `helper_2_id`, `warehouse_id`, `trip_type`, `status`, `is_outsourced`, `clock_in_at`/`clock_out_at` |
| `scm.trip_stops` | `0053:94`. Ordered stops; route metrics `leg_distance_m`, `leg_duration_s`, `eta_offset_s`, `route_optimised_at` (`0134:19-22`), `dp_no` (`0137:37`), stop type `SUPPLIER_PICKUP` (`0128`) |
| `scm.drivers` | `driver_code`, `name`, `phone`, `ic_number`, `vehicle`, `in_house` (`0053:36`), `active`; `company_id` (`0083:306-307`). Table itself predates this repo's migrations |
| `scm.helpers` | `0053:38-48`. `helper_code` UNIQUE, `name`, **`contact`** (not `phone`), `ic_number`, `in_house`, `active` |
| `scm.lorries` | `0053:50-65`. `plate` UNIQUE, `type` (`scm.lorry_type`), `is_internal`, `warehouse_id`, `capacity_m3`, `capacity_kg`, `active`; extended by `0121:62-86` with `model`, `purchase_*`, `road_tax_expiry`, `insurance_expiry`, `puspakom_expiry` |
| `scm.lorry_maintenance`, `scm.lorry_service_records` | `0053:110-120`, `0121:99` |
| `scm.dp_orders` | `0129:30-63`. `dp_no`, `job_type` (`scm.trip_stop_type`), `party_type`, address + `postcode` + `state`, `requested_date`, `trip_id`, `status` |
| `scm.delivery_planning_regions` / `scm.state_delivery_regions` | `0053:198` / `0053:208`. The region master and the state→region map keyed on a state **name** (`state_key`) |
| `scm.delivery_legs` | `0053:123`. The removed multi-hop feature; table still present, unused |

Enums (`0053:27-33`): `delivery_state`, `lorry_type`, `delivery_leg_kind`,
`delivery_leg_source`, `trip_type`, `trip_status`, `trip_stop_type`.

Seeded state→region mapping: `0053_scm_delivery_planning_tms.sql:230-263` (the
original 6 buckets), reconciled to 5 by
`0159_scm_reconcile_delivery_regions.sql:38-82` (KL / NORTHERN / SOUTHERN /
EAST_COAST / EM; Singapore folds into Southern). A fresh environment seeded from
`0053` alone differs from production until `0159` runs — the code comment at
`delivery-planning.ts:92-97` says so too.

> `backend/src/db/schema.pg.ts` models **none** of these. It carries only the
> legacy `public` Drizzle tables (`lorries` `:306`, `trips` `:321`, `trip_stops`

## 5. Performance summary

Optimized:
- Region config, warehouse labels and the SO header page are each read once per
  request and reused across all four row sources.
- `paginateAll` on the SO header read (`:466-479`) and on the region config
  (`:139-146`, `:164-170`) so PostgREST's 1000-row cap cannot silently truncate.
- Every non-SO union is wrapped in try/catch, so one bad row degrades that
  source instead of 500-ing the board.
- Board list query keeps previous rows across tab switches; masters cache 60 s;
  Driver / Lorry writes are optimistic.

Watch as data grows — this endpoint is the module's whole cost model:
- **The board has no server-side pagination and no date bound.** Every live SO
  with a delivery signal is read on every load, then the ASSR, DP and project
  unions are added, then region/state filtering happens **in memory**
  (`:1358-1367`). Row count grows monotonically with the SO table.
- `dp_orders` is the one source with a hard cap (`.limit(1000)`, `:1136`) —
  silent truncation past that.
- The ASSR union is an unbounded `SELECT` over open, dated `public.assr_cases`
  (`:981-1004`) with no LIMIT.
- Mobile fetches `?region=ALL&state=ALL` — the entire board — and buckets three
  days out of it client-side (`MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:290-294`). Phones pay
  the full board cost to render one day.

The scaling model for the neighbouring SCM lists (fixed base + per-row cost, and
where it breaks) is in `docs/scm-scaling-audit.md`; the cross-module audit is
`docs/perf-optimization-plan.md`.

## 6. Who can see and do what

**The backend is the authority.** Page admission on the frontend reads the
server-supplied `page_access` map; it does not compute the rule. The one place
that re-derives a backend rule locally is called out below.

### One area key gates the whole module

Every TMS router is mounted behind `scmAreaGuard('scm.transportation.drivers')`
(`backend/src/scm/index.ts:431-467` (`/drivers` :431, `/delivery-planning` :436, `/delivery-planning-regions` :449, `/trips` :451, `/dp-orders` :453, `/lorry-capacity` :458, `/helpers` :460, `/lorries` :462, `/lorry-service-records` :466)) — `/drivers`, `/delivery-planning`,
`/delivery-planning-regions` (plus `{ openRead: true }`), `/trips`,
`/dp-orders`, `/lorry-capacity`, `/helpers`, `/lorries`,
`/lorry-service-records`. There is no per-endpoint `requirePermission` in this
module.

`scmAreaGuard` (`backend/src/scm/middleware/area-guard.ts:112-210`) resolves in
this order:

1. `*` (Owner / IT) → through, never gated (`:122-126`).
2. Sales JD **deny**, then Sales JD **write-cap**, then the money-write deny —
   rules in code, enforced always, ahead of the rollout fallthrough
   (`:135-166`).
3. `user.scm_l2_configured === false` → **through** (`:168-172`). The no-lockout
   rollout: a caller with no explicit SCM L2 rows falls back to the coarse
   `scm.access` umbrella enforced upstream.
4. Otherwise per-method: GET/HEAD need `view`, POST/PATCH/PUT/DELETE need `edit`
   on the area (`:190-193`).

So in practice: **read the board = `view` on `scm.transportation.drivers`;
schedule / assign / edit fields = `edit` on the same key** — unless the caller
is not L2-configured, in which case `scm.access` is the real gate.

### Row scope — a driver sees only their own jobs

`resolveDeliveryScope` (`backend/src/scm/lib/deliveryScope.ts:105-149`) narrows
a caller only when **both** signals agree:

1. **Intent** — `resolvePositionPolicy` classifies them into the `restricted`
   cohort (Driver / Helper / Storekeeper / Storekeeper Supervisor,
   `backend/src/services/positionPolicy.ts:300-307`). Keyed on the policy
   cohort, not a position-name regex, so a rename cannot inject or drop a
   restriction.
2. **Identity** — at least one `scm.drivers` / `scm.helpers` row resolves via
   `user_id` (`:129-136`).

Every other outcome **fails open to `mode: 'all'`** — wildcard, non-restricted
position, unresolvable identity, lookup error (`:110-146`). The rationale is in
the file header: this change can only ever reduce exposure, never lock a driver
out of their own jobs. An unassigned job never matches a `self` scope
(`scopeMatchesAssignment` `:157-165`), so it stays visible to ops only.

Where it is enforced:

| Site | File:line |
|---|---|
| Board read (rows filtered after assembly) | `delivery-planning.ts:418`, `:1347-1349`, helper `:317-369` |
| `PATCH /delivery-planning/:type/:id/fields` (write ownership → 403 `NOT_YOUR_JOB`) | `:1553-1566` |
| Trips list / detail / status | `trips.ts:128-131`, `:153-154`, `:292-293` |
| DP orders list + act | `dp-orders.ts:102`, `:118-125`, `:247` |

> **Deliberately unscoped — owner ruling 2026-07-22. Do not "fix" this.**
> `PATCH /delivery-planning/:type/:id/schedule` — the route that assigns driver
> and lorry and creates trips — does **not** call `resolveDeliveryScope`, and
> must not. Scheduling is a ONE-PERSON function: a single dispatcher assigns the
> whole operation's jobs. Narrowing the handler to the caller's own assignments
> would lock that dispatcher out of every job they do not already own — the
> exact opposite of what the business needs. Its gate is the area guard's `edit`
> level on `scm.transportation.drivers`, and that is intended to be the complete
> gate.
>
> The asymmetry with `/fields` (`:1553-1566`, which **does** scope) is the point.
> `/fields` narrows because editing a job's own data — steps, POD, execution
> timestamps — is a per-owner act. Assignment is the opposite act: it decides
> whose job it becomes, so it cannot be scoped by ownership it creates. Adding
> the scope call to make the two routes match would be a behaviour change against
> a standing ruling, not a consistency fix. The handler carries the same note at
> `delivery-planning.ts:1682-1704`, and
> `backend/tests/scheduleScopeRuling.test.ts` fails loudly if a scope call is
> added.
>
> What would justify revisiting: if scheduling ever stops being one person —
> per-region or per-depot dispatchers each owning a slice of the board — then
> `resolveDeliveryScope` is the mechanism to reach for, extended with a
> region/depot mode rather than the existing `self` (which keys on crew
> assignment and would be the wrong axis). Until the operation actually splits,
> unscoped is correct.

### Frontend gates

| Surface | Gate | File |
|---|---|---|
| `/scm/delivery-planning`, `/scm/trips`, `/scm/delivery-planning-regions`, `/scm/fleet`, `/scm/lorry-capacity` | `<ScmGuard area="scm.transportation.drivers">` | `App.tsx:601-605` |
| `ScmGuard` | delegates to `<Guard perm="scm.access" anyAccess={[area]}>` — an OR of the flat permission and the server's `page_access` map | `App.tsx:240-269`, `Guard` at `:183-222` |
| Sidebar entries | `anyPerm ["*","scm.access"]`, `anyAccess ["scm.transportation.drivers"]`, `hideForSalesRep: true` | `Sidebar.tsx:515-524` |
| Mobile screens | resolved through the same nav table (`gateVia`) | `MobileApp.tsx:114`, `:157-184`, `:718` |

No `PageGuard` wraps any delivery route — `PageGuard` is for the
service-case / sales / projects family.

> **Frontend re-derivation, by design but worth knowing.** The board's
> "Convert to DO" actions are gated by `canOperateDeliveryOrders(user, can,
> pageAccess)` (`DeliveryPlanning.tsx:526`), which is
> `canOperateScmSalesDoc` (`frontend/src/auth/salesAccess.ts:187-206`):
> `can("*") || !isSalesStaff(user) && ACCESS_RANK[pageAccess("scm.sales.delivery")]
> >= edit`. It restates two backend terms — the area guard's `edit` requirement
> and `salesJdWriteDenial` — in the frontend, deliberately, so a button it shows
> cannot 403 (its own docblock `:157-186` explains the four hand-copies it
> replaced). It is a mirror, not the authority: the backend still refuses.
> Unlike `scm.maintenance.open` there is **no backend capability** covering this
> today (`backend/src/services/capabilities.ts` has none for delivery), so if a
> third rule term ever lands, this mirror is where it will drift.

## 7. Desktop and mobile files that must change together

| Change | Desktop | Mobile | Shared / authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| The 4 states, their labels, their meaning | `pages/scm-v2/DeliveryPlanning.tsx` (`STATE_TABS` `:192`, tab row `:1148`) | `mobile/MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx` (`Bucket` `:64`, pills) | `vendor/scm/lib/delivery-planning-queries.ts:19-29` for the constants; `derivePlanningState` (`backend/.../delivery-planning.ts:283-308`) for the RULE |
| Board row shape / new column | `DeliveryPlanning.tsx` columns | `MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx` `BoardRow` `:79` and the job card | `PlanningOrder` type in `delivery-planning-queries.ts:47` — add the field there first |
| Region model | `DeliveryPlanningRegions.tsx` | `MobileModuleList.tsx:1957` (`delivery-planning-regions`) | `stateToRegionsFromConfig` + the two config tables |
| Driver / Helper / Lorry masters | `Fleet.tsx` (`DriversSection` `:98`, `HelpersSection` `:294`, `LorriesSection` `:461`) | `MobileModuleList.tsx:1327` / `:1357` / `:1857` | `drivers-queries.ts` / `helpers-queries.ts` / `lorries-queries.ts` |
| Assignment + scheduling | `DriverEditCell` `:305`, `LorryEditCell` `:340`, bulk `:660-665` | read-only rows `MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx:1612-1613` | `useScheduleDelivery` (`delivery-planning-queries.ts:397`) → `PATCH …/schedule` |
| Status writes / POD | board row actions | `MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx` (`PATCH /delivery-orders-mfg/:id/status`), `MobilePOD.tsx` | the DO status machine in `delivery-orders-mfg.ts` |
| Access gating | `App.tsx:601-605` + `Sidebar.tsx:515-524` | `MobileApp.tsx:114,157-184` | `scmAreaGuard('scm.transportation.drivers')` |

Note the asymmetry that is intentional and must be preserved: mobile is a
**driver run-sheet** (Today / Tomorrow / History, read-only crew), desktop is
the **planning board** (4 states, region chips, assignment). One backend, one
state machine, two presentations.
