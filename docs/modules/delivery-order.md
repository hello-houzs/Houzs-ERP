# Module: Delivery Order (SCM)

Per-module technical doc — the data flow from the screen down to the database,
plus the performance characteristics. Sibling of `sales-order.md`; the DO is a
faithful clone of the SO API (editable SO-style header, line CRUD, payments
ledger, `recomputeTotals`) with one thing the SO does not have: **it moves stock**.

> Convention: money is in **sen** (integer cents) end-to-end. Dates are stored
> UTC, displayed DD/MM/YYYY. All reads/writes go through `/api/scm/*`.
>
> Line references are against `main` @ `8f8427ed`.

Doc-flow position: **SO → DO → SI**, with **DO → DR** (Delivery Return) as the
reversal branch. The DO is the OUT half of the inventory ledger.

## 1. Frontend

### Screens
| Surface | File | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Desktop list | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/MfgDeliveryOrdersListV2.tsx` | Server-paginated, `pageSize = 50` (`:834`), page in `?page=`. Sends the **bucket name** as `status` (`:854`). Revenue card is page-only; In-transit / Delivered cards read full-set `statusCounts` (`:878-880`). |
| Desktop detail | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderDetailV2.tsx` | Header + lines + payments + crew. |
| Desktop new | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderNewV2.tsx` | |
| Desktop from-SO | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderFromSo.tsx` | Line-level picker over `/deliverable-so-lines`. |
| Desktop report | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderDetailListing.tsx` | Detail-listing report. |
| Mobile list | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` | `MODULE_CONFIGS["delivery-orders-mfg"]` (`:1064-1106`). |
| Mobile detail | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx` | Config `:241`; status actions `:480-494`. |
| Mobile POD | `frontend/src/mobile/MobilePOD.tsx` | The driver screen — signature + photo + `PATCH /:id/status` (`:167`). |
| Mobile convert (SO→DO) | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileConvertWizard.tsx` | `target = "do"` (`:72`). |
| Mobile planning board | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileDeliveryPlanning.tsx` | |

Desktop routes: `frontend/src/App.tsx:654-657`, behind
`<ScmGuard area="scm.sales.delivery" allowSales>` for list + detail (read), and
without `allowSales` for new / from-so.

### Data hooks
`frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/delivery-order-queries.ts`

- `useMfgDeliveryOrdersPaged({page,pageSize,status,q,sort})` (`:215`) — the desktop
  list. `queryKey: ['mfg-delivery-orders-paged', ...]`, `placeholderData: prev`,
  `staleTime: 30_000`.
- `useMfgDeliveryOrders(status?)` (`:198`) — legacy unpaginated,
  `['mfg-delivery-orders', status ?? 'all']`.
- `useMfgDeliveryOrderDetail(id)` (`:233`) — `['mfg-delivery-order-detail', id]`.
- `useMfgDeliveryOrderPayments(id)` (`:370`) — `['mfg-delivery-orders', id, 'payments']`,
  `staleTime: 2 * 60_000` (longer than the rest).
- `useDeliverableSoLines*` (`:54`, `:116`) and `useSoConvertHeader` (`:101`) feed
  the SO→DO pickers.
- `useCreateMfgDeliveryOrder` (`:249`) takes an **optional `idempotencyKey`**,
  destructured out of the body so it is not posted as a DO field. The comment at
  `:239-248` says why it matters: a duplicate DO is not a duplicate row, it
  decrements stock again and carries into SI.

**`releaseSoSideQueries`** (`:190-196`) is the DO module's most important cache
rule: any mutation that moves an SO line's live remaining-to-deliver (create,
line qty change, line delete, cancel) must invalidate the SO lists, the SO
detail, and force-refetch `['mfg-delivery-orders','deliverable-so-lines']` —
otherwise a released qty looks stuck and the Issue-DO menu stays hidden until a
hard refresh.

`useUpdateMfgDeliveryOrderStatus` (`:264`) additionally invalidates
`['inventory']` (`:276`), because a shipped transition deducts stock.

### Caching / loading behaviour
Three layers as in `docs/modules/sales-order.md` §1. DO specifics:

- The **legacy** key `mfg-delivery-orders` is whitelisted for the localStorage
  snapshot (`frontend/src/lib/query-persist.ts:95`); the **paged** key is not
  (different first segment).
- The payments sub-key `['mfg-delivery-orders', <id>, 'payments']` is explicitly
  excluded from persistence (`query-persist.ts:100-133`). The comment there is a
  bug post-mortem worth reading before touching that file: a persisted payment
  ledger was rehydrated as fresh data and MobilePOD turned it into the balance a
  driver collects.

## 2. API surface

`backend/src/scm/routes/delivery-orders-mfg.ts`, mounted at
`/api/scm/delivery-orders-mfg` (`backend/src/scm/index.ts:257`) behind
`scmAreaGuard('scm.sales.delivery', { readInheritsFrom: 'scm.sales.orders' })`
(`:256`) — a salesperson may READ the DOs generated from their own SOs; writes
still need `edit` on `scm.sales.delivery`.

| Method | Path | Line | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | `:2188` | List. `?page=` opts into pagination + `statusCounts`. |
| GET | `/deliverable-so-lines` | `:2347` | SO lines with `remaining > 0` (qty − delivered + returned). |
| GET | `/so-source/:docNo` | `:2425` | SO header fields for the convert form. |
| GET | `/:id` | `:2451` | Header + items + `has_children` + `lifecycle_state` + crew. |
| POST | `/` | `:2591` | Create. `asDraft: true` → DRAFT (no stock); else born DISPATCHED. |
| POST | `/from-sos` | `:2976` | Line-level batch convert from SO picks. |
| PUT | `/:id/crew` | `:3314` | Driver / helper / lorry assignment + snapshot. |
| PATCH | `/:id` | `:3450` | Header edit (+ SO amend-field mirror). |
| POST/PATCH/DELETE | `/:id/items[/:itemId]` | `:3636` / `:3784` / `:4005` | Line CRUD. |
| GET/POST/DELETE | `/:id/payments[/:paymentId]` | `:4075` / `:4118` / `:4155` | Payments ledger. |
| PATCH | `/:id/status` | `:4359` (handler `:4166`) | **The stock chokepoint.** |

## 3. Backend

### The list handler — `deliveryOrdersMfg.get('/')` (`:2188-2336`)

1. **Row scope first** (`:2194-2201`). `canViewAllSales(c)` (permission
   `scm.so.view_all` or a director position) else `resolveSalesScopeIds` gives the
   caller's own + downline scm.staff uuids, applied as `.in('salesperson_id', ...)`.
   Pass the **Houzs** user id (`c.get('houzsUser')?.id`), not `user.id` — the
   comment at `:2191` records that this was the non-admin 500. No Houzs identity
   and no view-all ⇒ an explicit 403 with a readable message (`:2199`), never a
   silent empty list.
2. **Two paths, chosen by `page`** (`:2210-2211`).
   - Legacy (`:2220-2228`): `order do_date desc`, `.limit(500)`, `scopeToCompany`,
     raw `status` equality.
   - Paginated (`:2229-2296`): sort whitelist
     `do_date | do_number | debtor_name | status | customer_delivery_date` (`:2235`)
     + `do_number` tiebreaker; bucket resolution via `DO_STATUS_BUCKETS` (`:2180-2185`);
     `q` ilikes over `do_number, so_doc_no, debtor_name, debtor_code, ref,
     branding, sales_location, driver_name` plus normalized phone parts (`:2259-2264`);
     `from`/`to` on `do_date`.
   - `statusCounts` = five `head:true count:'exact'` in one `Promise.all` (`:2283-2289`),
     company- and scope-filtered so tab counts cannot leak the other company's totals.
3. **Enrichment — one parallel wave of THREE reads** (`:2309-2313`):
   non-cancelled `delivery_returns` by `delivery_order_id`, non-cancelled
   `sales_invoices` by `delivery_order_id`, and `computeDoLifecycle` (`:1999`).
   The first two collapse into `has_children`; the third gives
   `lifecycle_state` (`'shipped' | 'invoiced' | 'returned'`, `:1998`).
4. **Finance gate** (`:2322-2333`) — `canViewScmFinance(c)`; when false every
   `DO_FINANCE_KEYS` column (`:317-321`) is deleted from every row. Note
   `local_total_centi` is deliberately NOT in that list: the DO total is visible
   to everyone, cost and margin are not.

### Main mutation paths

- **Create** (`:2591`). Guards in order: item-code catalog check (`:2600-2604`), then
  the source-SO gate — every SO referenced by `soDocNo` or by any line's
  `soItemId` must be past `SO_UNDELIVERABLE_STATUSES` (`firstUndeliverableSo`,
  `:2146`). `asDraft === true` → `status: 'DRAFT'`, otherwise the DO is born
  **DISPATCHED** (`:2785`) and stock is deducted immediately (`:2842-2855`). The
  create path also fires `syncSoDeliveredFromDo` and the customer DO email.
- **`/from-sos`** (`:2976`). Same shape, `asDraft` respected at `:3185` / `:3283`.
- **Header PATCH** (`:3450`). Locked once a DR/SI exists (`:3544`). Strips the
  three amend fields out of the DO update and mirrors them onto the parent SO
  instead, writing a separate audit row on the **SO's** timeline
  (`prepareSoAmendMirrorAudit`, `:221-260`). `delivery_substatus` is whitelisted
  against `HC_SUBSTATUS_VALUES` (`:209-212`).
- **Line add** (`:3636`). Item-code guard, then `doHasDownstream`. If the DO is
  already shipped, the new line ships immediately via resync, so a stock
  availability check runs first unless the caller passes `confirmShortStock`
  (`:3658-3670`).
- **Line delete** (`:4005`). Deliberately **not** gated by the doc-level lock — it
  uses the per-line `doLineConsumedQty` (`:1468`) instead, so deleting a
  non-consumed line on a shipped DO is allowed and re-syncs inventory.
- **Status PATCH** (`patchDeliveryOrderStatusHandler`, `:4166`) — see §5 and §6.

---

## 4. Database

Schema `scm`. Baseline DDL `backend/scripts/scm-schema/2990s-full-schema.sql:176`
(`delivery_orders`) and `:148` (`delivery_order_items`); the authoritative in-code
column lists are `HEADER` (`delivery-orders-mfg.ts:292-310`), `ITEM` (`:333-337`),
`PAYMENT_COLS` (`:339-342`) and `crewSnapshotCols` (`:347-351`).

| Table | Role |
|-------|------|
| `scm.delivery_orders` | DO header. `do_number`, `so_doc_no`, `debtor_code/name`, `do_date`, `expected_delivery_at`, `customer_delivery_date`, `dispatched_at` / `signed_at` / `delivered_at`, `driver_id/name`, `vehicle`, `m3_total_milli`, address block, `salesperson_id`, `branding`, `venue_id`, per-category revenue + cost subtotals, `local_total_centi`, `total_cost_centi`, `total_margin_centi`, `line_count`, `warehouse_id`, `is_dropship`, `arrives_em_warehouse_date`, `pod_r2_key`, `signature_data`, `status`, `company_id`. |
| `scm.delivery_order_items` | DO lines. `so_item_id` (the SO link that drives warehouse resolution + remaining-qty caps), `item_code`, `item_group`, `qty`, `m3_milli`, `unit_price_centi`, `discount_centi`, `line_total_centi`, `unit_cost_centi`, `line_cost_centi`, `line_margin_centi`, **`ship_cost_centi`**, `variants`, `line_delivery_date`, `line_delivery_date_overridden`, `rack_id`. |
| `scm.delivery_order_payments` | Payments taken at delivery. `method`, `merchant_provider`, `installment_months`, `online_type`, `approval_code`, `amount_centi`, `account_sheet`, `collected_by`. |
| `scm.delivery_order_crew` | One row per DO (UNIQUE `do_id`): driver/helper/lorry FKs plus the assign-time name/IC/contact/plate snapshot. |
| `scm.inventory_movements` | Where the OUT lands. Keyed `(source_doc_type='DO', source_doc_id, product_code, variant_key)` by the partial unique index the reversal has to route around (`:4322-4328`). |
| `scm.mfg_sales_order_items` | Upstream: `warehouse_id` is the **authoritative** ship-from warehouse per line. |

Status vocabulary (`:366-376`):
`DO_STATUSES` = DRAFT, LOADED, DISPATCHED, IN_TRANSIT, SIGNED, DELIVERED,
INVOICED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED. `DO_PRESHIP_STATUSES` = DRAFT, LOADED.
`SHIPPED_STATES` (`:357`) = DISPATCHED, IN_TRANSIT, SIGNED, DELIVERED, INVOICED.
`DO_STOCK_OUT_STATUSES` = `SHIPPED_STATES` ∪ {COMPLETED}.
Filter buckets (`:2180-2185`): `open` = DRAFT+LOADED, `in_transit` =
DISPATCHED+IN_TRANSIT, `delivered` = SIGNED+DELIVERED+INVOICED+COMPLETED,
`cancelled` = CANCELLED.

---

## 5. Stock direction

**A Delivery Order moves inventory OUT.**

**When:** the FIRST transition into ANY status in `SHIPPED_STATES`
(`:357`). This is deliberately a set, not a single status, so a DO that jumps
straight to SIGNED or DELIVERED still deducts exactly once. There are two entry
points to that same deduction:

- **Non-draft create** (`:2842-2843`) — the DO is born DISPATCHED, so
  `deductInventoryForDo` runs right after the item insert.
- **Status PATCH** (`:4284-4285`) — `if (SHIPPED_STATES.includes(body.status))`.
  A DRAFT confirm is exactly DRAFT→DISPATCHED, so the deduction skipped at
  draft-create fires here (`:4277-4283`).

`deductInventoryForDo` (`:831`) is idempotent by two mechanisms: a pre-insert
existence check on `(source_doc_type='DO', source_doc_id, movement_type='OUT')`
(`:832-839`), and a partial UNIQUE index as the hard backstop against a race. It
collapses identical `(warehouse_id, product_code, variant_key, batch_no)` lines
into one OUT row (`:881-905`).

**Which warehouse:** `resolveDoLineWarehouses` (`:645`), in order —
(1) the linked SO line's `warehouse_id`, (2) the DO header's `warehouse_id`,
(3) the global default. A line that resolves to none is **skipped**, never
guessed. Stock never crosses warehouses.

**Reversal:** cancelling a DO writes a FIFO-neutral positive **ADJUSTMENT**, not
an IN — `reverseInventoryForDo` (`:1328`, called at `:4330`). The comment at
`:4322-4328` explains why `reverseMovements` cannot be used: its balancing IN
reuses the DO source key that the partial unique index rejects, so the insert
would silently fail and the shipped stock would stay permanently deducted.
Rack stock is returned separately by `returnDoRacksOnCancel` (`:1073`, called
`:4336`).

**Drop-ship:** a DO flagged `is_dropship` ships against the expected PO batch
BEFORE any receipt, so its OUT consumes no lot. The GRN's
`reconcileDropshipBatches` settles that later (`grns.ts:460`). This is why
cancelling the PO is blocked while such an OUT is outstanding
(`mfg-purchase-orders.ts:252-283`).

The IN counterpart of a DO is the **Delivery Return** (`/delivery-returns`),
a separate module.

---

## 6. What locks and when

| Trigger | What stops | Enforced at |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Any non-cancelled **DR or SI** on the DO | header PATCH, line add, line edit, and the CANCELLED transition | `doHasDownstream` (`:269-284`) called at `:3544`, `:3648`, `:3796`, `:4232` |
| Line already invoiced or returned | that line's DELETE | `doLineConsumedQty` (`:1468`), checked `:4014-4022` — per-line, deliberately finer than the doc-level lock |
| Status already CANCELLED | every further transition — **CANCELLED is FINAL** | `:4203-4209`. Un-cancelling would leave the cancel's add-back ADJUSTMENT standing while `deductInventoryForDo` no-ops, inflating stock by the whole DO. Re-deliver via a NEW DO. |
| DO has shipped (`DO_STOCK_OUT_STATUSES`) | moving back to DRAFT / LOADED | `:4219-4225`. A plain status write does not reverse the OUT, so the DO would read un-shipped while its stock stayed deducted. |
| Unknown status string | the whole request | `:4171-4176` — the handler historically wrote `body.status` verbatim. |
| Shipped statuses (frontend) | the line editor renders read-only | `DeliveryOrderDetailV2.tsx:1362` — `["dispatched","in_transit","signed","delivered","invoiced"]` |

**Amendment path — no, not on the DO itself.** There is no `do_revisions` table
and no revision counter (verified: no such table is referenced anywhere in
`backend/src/`). What exists instead is the **SO amend mirror**: the DO create and
PATCH handlers accept `amendDateFromCustomer` / `amendedDeliveryDate` /
`amendReason`, strip them from the DO update, and write them onto the parent
`mfg_sales_orders` row, logging the change on the SO's timeline
(`prepareSoAmendMirrorAudit`, `:221-260`; create-side mirror at `:2869-2874`).
`customer_delivery_date` is never overwritten by that mirror.

Corrections to a shipped DO go through cancel (which reverses stock) + a new DO,
or through a Delivery Return.

---

## 7. The cost / money columns — frozen vs live

Everything is integer sen.

| Column | Where | Frozen or live |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `unit_price_centi`, `discount_centi`, `line_total_centi` | line | Live until the DO locks. |
| `unit_cost_centi`, `line_cost_centi`, `line_margin_centi` | line | **Live — overwritten in place.** `restampDoActualCost` (`:527`) re-derives them from the actual booked movement cost per `(warehouse, product, variant, batch)` bucket (bucket math `:563-598`), and it re-runs at ship, on line-set change, and again via `recost.ts` when a supplier PI lands. |
| **`ship_cost_centi`** | line | **FROZEN at ship.** `freezeShipCost(current, unitCost)` (`backend/src/scm/lib/fulfillment-costing.ts:44`) returns `undefined` — meaning "do not write the column" — whenever the value is already non-null. Called at `:615-616`. So the FIRST post-ship costing captures the true ship-time FIFO unit cost and no later recost can touch it. Column added by `backend/src/db/migrations-pg/0143_scm_do_ship_cost_snapshot.sql`. |
| `local_total_centi` | header | Derived by `recomputeTotals` (`:399`) from the lines. Visible to everyone. |
| per-category `*_centi` / `*_cost_centi`, `total_cost_centi`, `total_margin_centi`, `margin_pct_basis` | header | Derived; **finance-gated** (`DO_FINANCE_KEYS`, `:317-321`) on both list and detail. |
| `amount_centi` | `delivery_order_payments` | The ledger. Not rolled into the DO header. |

Why the freeze exists: the three-way cost comparison
① SO order-time cost → ② DO ship-time FIFO → ③ SI landed cost only survives if ②
is snapshotted, because the in-place restamp collapses ② into ③ after a PI
(`fulfillment-costing.ts:33-43`). `ship_cost_centi` is NULL on legacy DOs.

`recomputeTotals` (`:399`) **fails closed and never throws** (`:408-420`): a
failed read aborts the roll-up with a log rather than writing a zeroed header,
and it aborts by logging rather than throwing because it only ever runs after its
triggering line write committed — a throw would become a 500 the client retries
into a duplicate line.

---

## 8. Desktop and mobile files that must change together

| Concern | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| List columns / filters / buckets | `pages/scm-v2/MfgDeliveryOrdersListV2.tsx` | `mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` config `:1064` |
| Server pagination opt-in | `useMfgDeliveryOrdersPaged` | `mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` `SERVER_PAGINATED` (`:325`) |
| Detail fields | `pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderDetailV2.tsx` | `mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx` config `:241` |
| Status ladder / who may advance it | `DeliveryOrderDetailV2.tsx` action bar | `mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx:480-494`, gated by `useMayOperateDoc` (`:454`) → `canOperateDeliveryOrders` (`frontend/src/auth/salesAccess.ts:200`) — the SAME helper the desktop uses |
| SO→DO conversion | `pages/scm-v2/DeliveryOrderFromSo.tsx` | `mobile/MobileConvertWizard.tsx` (`target: "do"`) |
| Proof of delivery / collect payment | `DeliveryOrderDetailV2.tsx` payments panel | `mobile/MobilePOD.tsx` |
| Cache invalidation after a write | the hooks in `vendor/scm/lib/delivery-order-queries.ts` | `mobile/sharedInvalidate.ts:69` (`DO_ROOTS` + `STOCK_ROOTS`) |

`canOperateDeliveryOrders` is worth singling out: Sales staff get view + Print but
no operate, on **both** surfaces, resolved through one helper. Controls must be
made ABSENT rather than disabled (`salesAccess.ts:183-186`).

---

## 9. Performance summary

Optimized:
- List enrichment is already **one parallel wave of three reads** (`:2309-2313`) —
  DR count, SI count, lifecycle — not a serial chain.
- Detail folds the DR/SI counts into a `Promise.all` (`:2473-2482`).
- Desktop list is server-paginated (50/page) with server-side search, sort and
  status counts.
- Phone search goes through `phoneSearchOrParts` + `normalizePhone` (`:2263`) so a
  formatted number still matches.

Watch as data grows:
- The legacy unpaginated path still `.limit(500)` (`:2222`); the mobile convert
  wizard fetches `/delivery-orders-mfg?limit=200` (`MobileConvertWizard.tsx:239`).
- `statusCounts` costs five `count:'exact'` queries per paginated request
  (`:2283-2289`), each of which also carries the sales-scope `.in(...)`.
- `resolveSalesScopeIds` runs on **every** list and detail request; a deep
  reporting-line downline makes the `.in('salesperson_id', ...)` array large.
- `deductInventoryForDo` and `restampDoActualCost` both read
  `inventory_movements` filtered by `source_doc_id` — fine per document, but they
  run inside the status transition's request.

Cross-module context: `docs/perf-optimization-plan.md`. Route/permission
inventory: `docs/generated/`.
