# Module: Goods Received Note / GRN (SCM)

Per-module technical doc — the data flow from the screen down to the database,
plus the performance characteristics. Sibling of `sales-order.md`. The GRN is the
receiving step of the buy chain and the document that **creates FIFO stock**, so
it carries more inventory machinery than the other three siblings combined.

> Convention: money is in **sen** (integer cents) end-to-end. Dates are stored
> UTC, displayed DD/MM/YYYY. All reads/writes go through `/api/scm/*`.
>
> Line references are against `main` @ `8f8427ed`.

Doc-flow position: **PO → GRN → PI**, with **GRN → PR** (Purchase Return) as the
send-back branch. The route file's own one-liner: *"PO → GRN → Purchase Invoice.
On POST, qty_received rolls up to PO items"* (`grns.ts:1-2`).

## 1. Frontend

### Screens
| Surface | File | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| Desktop list | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/GoodsReceivedListV2.tsx` | Server-paginated, `pageSize = 50` (`:455`). |
| Desktop detail (read) | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/GoodsReceivedDetailV2.tsx` | Read-only shell; `?edit=1` forwards to the legacy editor (`:240-248`), lazily loaded. |
| Desktop detail (edit) | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/GoodsReceivedDetail.tsx` | The inline editor. Lock logic at `:244-248`. |
| Desktop new | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/GrnNew.tsx` | Uses `usePurchaseOrders()` (the legacy unpaginated PO hook, `:156`). |
| Desktop from-PO | `frontend/src/pages/scm-v2/GrnFromPo.tsx` | Multi-select over `/outstanding-po-items`. |
| Mobile list | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` | `MODULE_CONFIGS.grns` (`:1159-1192`). |
| Mobile detail | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx` | Config `:324`; status actions `:535-542`. |
| Mobile convert (PO→GRN) | `frontend/src/mobile/MobileConvertWizard.tsx` | `target = "grn"`, **no line picker** — a whole-PO convert (`:74`, `:60-61`). |

Desktop routes: `frontend/src/App.tsx:542-545`, behind
`<ScmGuard area="scm.procurement.grn">`.

### Data hooks
`frontend/src/vendor/scm/lib/grn-queries.ts`

- `useGrnsPaged({page,pageSize,status,q,sort})` (`:93`) — the desktop list.
  `queryKey: ['grns-paged', ...]`, `placeholderData: prev`, `staleTime: 30_000`.
- `useGrns(status?)` (`:77`) — legacy unpaginated, `['grns', status ?? 'all']`.
- `useGrnDetail(id)` (`:110`) — `['grn-detail', id]`.
- `useCreateGrn` (`:125`), `usePostGrn` (`:139`), `useCancelGrn` (`:215`),
  `useUpdateGrnHeader` (`:155`), `useAddGrnItem` / `useUpdateGrnItem` /
  `useDeleteGrnItem` (`:171` / `:185` / `:199`).
- `useGrnFromPos` (`:44`), `usePurchaseInvoiceFromGrn` (`:233`),
  `usePurchaseReturnFromGrn` (`:284`), `usePurchaseReturnFromGrns` (`:60`).

**The stock-side invalidation rule:** every mutation that can move inventory also
invalidates `['inventory']` — `usePostGrn` (`:146`) and `useCancelGrn` (`:222`).
And because a GRN's stock IN changes the PO's `received_qty` and status,
`useGrnFromPos` invalidates `['mfg-purchase-orders']` too (`:53`) and
force-refetches the picker key (`:55`).

### Caching / loading behaviour
Three layers as in `docs/modules/sales-order.md` §1. GRN specifics:

- `"grns"` is whitelisted for the localStorage snapshot
  (`frontend/src/lib/query-persist.ts:97`); `"grns-paged"` is a different first
  segment and is not. `'outstanding-po-items'` is in the `SUBRESOURCE` deny set
  (`:103`), so the picker is never persisted.
- Mobile's `sharedInvalidate.ts:72` maps `"grns"` to
  `["grns", "grns-paged", "grn-detail", ...STOCK_ROOTS]`, and `STOCK_ROOTS`
  (`:55`) folds in the **SO** roots. That is deliberate: posting a GRN re-walks
  `recomputeSoStockAllocation`, which flips SO lines READY/PENDING, so posting a
  GRN changes SO list rows that never mention the GRN.

---

## 2. API surface

`backend/src/scm/routes/grns.ts`, mounted at `/api/scm/grns`
(`backend/src/scm/index.ts:239`) behind `scmAreaGuard('scm.procurement.grn')`
(`:238`).

| Method | Path | Line | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| GET | `/` | `:833` | List. `?page=` opts into pagination + `statusCounts`. |
| GET | `/outstanding-po-items` | `:998` | PO lines with `qty - received_qty > 0` on SUBMITTED / PARTIALLY_RECEIVED POs; the from-PO picker. |
| GET | `/:id` | `:1173` | Header + items + convert/lock flags + per-line source PO + per-line downstream. |
| GET | `/:id/linked` | `:1229` | Parent PO + downstream PIs + PRs. |
| POST | `/` | `:1268` | Create. `asDraft: true` → DRAFT; otherwise created POSTED and immediately posted (`:1471`). |
| POST | `/from-pos` | `:1491` | Whole-PO batch convert. **Auto-posts** (writes stock at once). |
| POST | `/from-po-items` | `:1775` | Line-level multi-select convert; one GRN per source PO, each created DRAFT then posted via the shared helper. |
| PATCH | `/:id/post` | `:1764` (handler `:1682`) | **The stock chokepoint**: DRAFT → POSTED. |
| PATCH | `/:id/cancel` | `:2033` | → CANCELLED; reverses the receipt. |
| PATCH | `/:id` | `:2210` | Header edit — **can move stock** (warehouse relocation, see §5). |
| POST/PATCH/DELETE | `/:id/items[/:itemId]` | `:2363` / `:2569` / `:2839` | Line CRUD — each re-syncs inventory on a POSTED GRN. |

The `asDraft` flag is the only way to create a draft: `POST /` with
`status: 'DRAFT'` in the body is rejected outright with
`draft_status_not_supported` (`:1277`).

---

## 3. Backend

### The list handler — `grns.get('/')` (`:833-983`)

1. **Select** (`:856` / `:874`) — one query with three embeds:
   `supplier:suppliers(...)`, `purchase_order:purchase_orders(id, po_number)` and
   `warehouse:warehouses!warehouse_id(...)`.
2. **Two paths, chosen by `page`** (`:844-845`).
   - Legacy (`:854-862`): `order received_at desc`, `.limit(500)`, optional
     `status` / `supplierId`, `scopeToCompany`.
   - Paginated (`:863-923`): sort whitelist
     `received_at | grn_number | status | total_centi` (`:869`) + `grn_number`
     tiebreaker; bucket resolution via `GRN_STATUS_BUCKETS` (`:827-831`); `q`
     ilikes over `grn_number, delivery_note_ref, notes` only (`:892` — supplier
     name and PO number are embedded resources); `from`/`to` on `received_at`.
   - `statusCounts` = four `head:true count:'exact'` in one `Promise.all` (`:911-916`).
3. **Enrichment — a genuine SEQUENTIAL chain**, and this is what makes the GRN
   list the most expensive of the four:
   - `paginateAll` over `grn_items` for the listed GRN ids (`:942-947`) — a paged
     read, so more than one round trip when a page's GRNs carry many lines.
   - **then** `grnLineDownstream(sb, [...grnByItem.keys()])` (`:961`, helper at
     `:1122`), which needs the item ids the previous step produced. It cannot be
     parallelised with it.
   - `computeGrnFlags` (`:815-821`) turns the lines into `has_children`,
     `fully_invoiced`, `fully_returned`; the downstream map rolls up into a deduped
     per-GRN `downstream` doc-number list (`:959-973`).
4. **Assemble** (`:974-980`) — `total_centi` is the **stored header value**, not a
   re-sum of the lines. The comment at `:926-933` explains why: the old per-line
   `qty_accepted * unit_price` sum ignored `discount_centi`, so the list Total
   drifted from the detail Total.

### `postGrnAndRollup` (`:338-527`) — the single post chokepoint

Called by the confirm handler (`:1733`), by `POST /` on the non-draft path
(`:1471`) and by `/from-po-items`. In order:

1. **Flip to POSTED FIRST, then recount** (`:346-355`). `recomputePoReceived`
   excludes DRAFT lines from a PO line's `received_qty`, so the confirm must flip
   the row before recounting or this GRN's own lines would not count. The update
   carries `.neq('status','CLOSED')`.
2. `recomputePoReceived(sb, touchedPoItemIds)` (`:363`).
3. **Authoritative receiving warehouse** (`:370-392`). When the GRN's PO-linked
   lines all share ONE warehouse, that warehouse **overrides** the header and is
   persisted. The comment records the incident: a frontend default once fell back
   to the first warehouse (CHINA) and silently received PO-bound goods into the
   wrong one, so MRP for the real warehouse still showed a shortage.
4. **FX** (`:393-400`). Line prices are in the GRN's own currency; the FIFO lot
   must carry MYR, so `unit_cost_sen = toMyrSen(unit_price_centi, exchange_rate)`.
   For an MYR GRN the rate is 1 and this is a byte-for-byte no-op.
5. **Landed-charge allocation** (`:401-411`). A `service` line (freight — no
   supplier, just description + amount) creates **no** inventory movement; its
   amount is pooled and spread across the goods lines by QTY / VALUE / CBM per the
   header `allocation_method`, persisted as `allocated_charge_centi`.
6. **The IN movements** (`:412-448`) — see §5.
7. **Three post-receipt reconciles**, all best-effort, all after the IN:
   `reconcileDropshipBatches` (`:460`), `reconcileUncostedOuts` (`:492`, the
   oversell retro-cost, scoped to shipments before `receiptCutoffTs`), and for
   each affected DO a `restampDoActualCost` + `restampSiFromDo` (`:474-511`).
8. `placeGrnLinesOnRacks` (`:516-519`) and `recomputeSoStockAllocation`
   (`:522-525`).

### Other mutation paths worth knowing

- **Confirm handler** (`postGrnHandler`, `:1682-1763`). Idempotent no-op on an
  already-POSTED GRN, and it deliberately records **nothing** in that case
  (`:1707-1712`). Refuses CANCELLED / CLOSED (`:1713`). Re-runs the over-receipt
  check that draft-create skipped (`:1717-1728`).
- **Cancel** (`:2033`). A DRAFT GRN short-circuits: flip to CANCELLED and reverse
  **nothing** (`:2058-2080`) — a draft committed no IN and no PO rollup, so
  reversing would drive stock negative. A POSTED GRN then passes two locks and an
  atomic `.neq('status','CANCELLED')` update (`:2107`) before the reversal.
- **Header PATCH** (`:2210`). Has **no** `grnHasDownstream` lock. What it does
  have is the warehouse-relocation block (`:2235-2280`): changing the warehouse on
  a POSTED GRN physically moves the stock (OUT of the old + IN to the new,
  carrying the same cost and source-PO batch), guarded by
  `grnReverseWouldGoNegative` on the old warehouse (`:2257`). Also calls
  `recostFromGrn` (`:2356`) when the rate changes.
- **Line edit** (`:2569`). On a POSTED GRN a qty or bucket change writes **delta
  movements**: a bucket change is OUT(old key, prev qty) + IN(new key, new qty);
  a plain qty change is a single IN or OUT for the delta (`:2775-2806`). Then
  `recostFromGrn` if price or bucket moved (`:2828`).
- **Line delete** (`:2839`). Locked by `grnHasDownstream` (`:2844`); on a POSTED
  GRN it writes a per-line reversing OUT carrying the receipt's batch (`:2957`).

## 4. Database

Schema `scm`. Baseline DDL `backend/scripts/scm-schema/2990s-full-schema.sql:371`
(`grns`) and `:335` (`grn_items`); the live tables carry columns added later
(`warehouse_id`, `exchange_rate`, `allocation_method`, `company_id`,
`invoiced_qty` / `returned_qty`, `rack_id`, `allocated_charge_centi`). The
authoritative in-code lists are `HEADER` (`grns.ts:529-534`) and `ITEM` (`:535-549`).

| Table | Role |
|-------|------|
| `scm.grns` | GRN header. `grn_number` (UNIQUE), `purchase_order_id`, `supplier_id`, **`warehouse_id`** (where the IN lands), `received_at`, `delivery_note_ref`, `status`, `currency`, **`exchange_rate`**, **`allocation_method`**, `subtotal_centi` / `tax_centi` / `total_centi`, `posted_at`, `company_id`. |
| `scm.grn_items` | GRN lines. `purchase_order_item_id` (the PO link that drives `received_qty`, the batch and the receiving warehouse), `material_kind/code/name`, `supplier_sku`, `qty_received`, **`qty_accepted`** (the qty that actually becomes stock), `qty_rejected`, `rejection_reason`, `unit_price_centi`, `discount_centi`, `line_total_centi`, `unit_cost_centi`, **`allocated_charge_centi`**, **`invoiced_qty`** / **`returned_qty`** (downstream consumption), `delivery_date`, `rack_id`, variant columns. |
| `scm.inventory_movements` | Where the IN lands: `movement_type='IN'`, `source_doc_type='GRN'`, `source_doc_id`, `source_doc_no`, `warehouse_id`, `product_code`, `variant_key`, `unit_cost_sen`, **`batch_no`** (= the source PO number). |
| `scm.inventory_balances` | Read by `grnReverseWouldGoNegative` (`:788-792`) to decide whether a reversal is safe. |
| `scm.purchase_order_items` | Upstream: `received_qty` is written by this module (`recomputePoReceived`, `:672`). |
| `scm.purchase_invoice_items` / `scm.purchase_return_items` | Downstream: they draw on `grn_item_id`, which is what moves `invoiced_qty` / `returned_qty`. |

Status vocabulary: `DRAFT | POSTED | CANCELLED | CLOSED`. Filter buckets
(`:827-831`) cover only `draft` / `posted` / `cancelled` — **CLOSED has no bucket**,
so a CLOSED GRN appears under "All" and nowhere else.

Migration-number caution: several in-code comments cite the **2990 source repo's**
numbering, which does not line up with `backend/src/db/migrations-pg/`. Verified
matches in this module's chain: `0082_scm_fx_landed_cost.sql`,
`0154_scm_oversell_retrocost.sql`, `0057_scm_dropship_do.sql`. Do not trust a bare
"migration NNNN" in a comment without checking the filename.

---

## 5. Stock direction

**A Goods Received Note moves inventory IN.**

**When:** at the DRAFT → POSTED transition, inside `postGrnAndRollup`
(`:412-448`). A DRAFT GRN commits **nothing** — no stock, no PO rollup
(`:1272-1276`). Three routes reach that same helper:

| Path | Behaviour |
|------|-----------|
| `PATCH /:id/post` (`:1764`) | The explicit confirm. |
| `POST /` without `asDraft` (`:1471`) | Created POSTED and posted in the same request. |
| `POST /from-pos` (`:1491`) | Whole-PO convert; **auto-posts**, which is why the mobile wizard deliberately uses `POST /grns { asDraft:true }` instead when it needs per-line received qty (`MobileConvertWizard.tsx:370-374`). |

**What is written** (`:418-442`):
- One `IN` movement per goods line with `qty_accepted > 0`.
- **Service lines are filtered out** (`:419-421`) — freight never enters
  inventory; its amount was already allocated into the goods lines' lot cost.
- `variant_key = computeVariantKey(item_group, variants)` — received stock is
  bucketed by attribute composition.
- `unit_cost_sen` = the landed MYR cost: base (FX-converted) + the per-unit
  allocated freight share (`:434-435`).
- `batch_no` = the **source PO number** (`:440`), so a sofa set's components share
  a dye lot. NULL for manual (no-PO) lines.
- The write result is captured, and a failure is surfaced as `movementErrors` in
  the response (`:443-448`) — it used to be silently swallowed, leaving a GRN
  POSTED with stock not booked.

**Reversal — three different OUT paths, all writing `movement_type: 'OUT'`:**

| Trigger | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Cancel a POSTED GRN | `:2150-2172` — per line, carrying each line's own PO batch so two lines of the same SKU from different POs each reverse their own dye lot |
| Delete a line on a POSTED GRN | `:2957` — a precise per-line OUT |
| Change qty / bucket on a POSTED GRN line | `:2775-2806` — delta movements (bucket change = OUT(old)+IN(new); qty change = one IN or OUT for the delta) |
| Change the warehouse on a POSTED GRN header | `:2235-2280` — OUT of the old warehouse + IN to the new, same cost + batch |

Every one of those is best-effort and never un-does the document
(`:2181` is the canonical example). Every one of them also re-walks
`recomputeSoStockAllocation`, because stock arriving or leaving flips SO lines
between READY and PENDING.

The OUT counterpart for goods sent back to the supplier is the **Purchase
Return** (`/purchase-returns`), a separate module.

---

## 6. What locks and when

| Trigger | What stops | Enforced at |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Any line has `invoiced_qty > 0` or `returned_qty > 0` (a PI or PR draws on it) | line add, line edit, line delete, **and cancel** | `grnHasDownstream` (`:741-748`) called at `:2373`, `:2577`, `:2844`, `:2084` |
| The received stock has already been consumed downstream (shipped / used) | **cancel**, and the warehouse relocation on the header PATCH | `grnReverseWouldGoNegative` (`:768-808`) called at `:2100` and `:2257`. It compares live `inventory_balances` per `(warehouse, product, variant)` against what the reversal would take out; short ⇒ 409 with *"Make a Purchase Return instead"*. Best-effort read: a balance-query error does NOT block. |
| Status CANCELLED or CLOSED | confirm | `:1713` |
| Status POSTED, DRAFT excluded | over-receipt beyond the PO line's remaining | `verifyGrnOverReceipt` (`:602`), re-run at confirm `:1725-1728` |
| Status not DRAFT / (POSTED without children) | the whole page read-only (frontend) | `GoodsReceivedDetail.tsx:246` — `isLocked = !(status === 'DRAFT' || (status === 'POSTED' && !hasChildren))`; the page drops out of edit mode automatically if it locks mid-edit (`:253-258`) |
| Source PO belongs to another company | all three create paths | `firstCrossCompanyPo` (`:30-48`) — receiving another company's PO would post the stock and its cost into the active company's books |

**The header PATCH is the exception**: it is NOT gated by `grnHasDownstream`. A
GRN with a downstream PI can still have its header edited, including a warehouse
change that physically relocates stock — that path is gated only by
`grnReverseWouldGoNegative` on the old warehouse (`:2257`). Stated as observed.

**Amendment path — no revision mechanism.** There is no `grn_revisions` table and
no `revision` column (contrast `purchase_orders.revision` +
`scm.po_revisions`, `docs/modules/purchase-order.md` §6). A wrong GRN is
corrected by editing while it is still editable, or by cancel (which reverses the
receipt) + a fresh GRN. Once a PI or PR has drawn on it, the sanctioned route is a
**Purchase Return**, not an edit.

---

## 7. The cost / money columns — frozen vs live

Everything is integer sen. The GRN is where a purchase's cost becomes the
**inventory lot cost**, so this table is the one that matters most.

| Column | Where | Frozen or live |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| `currency` | header | Copied from the source PO. |
| **`exchange_rate`** | header | MYR per 1 unit of the GRN currency; 1 for MYR. Set at create (`resolveGrnFx`, `:241`), editable on the header PATCH — and changing it triggers `recostFromGrn` (`:2356`). **The PO carries no rate; the GRN is where FX enters the money chain.** |
| `allocation_method` | header | QTY / VALUE / CBM basis for spreading freight. `normalizeAllocationMethod` (`:408`). |
| `unit_price_centi` | line | In the **GRN's own currency**, not MYR. Live while the GRN is editable. |
| `discount_centi`, `line_total_centi` | line | Live; `recomputeGrnTotals` (`:566`) sums `line_total_centi` into `subtotal_centi` = `total_centi` (a GRN carries no tax). |
| **`allocated_charge_centi`** | line | The freight share folded into this goods line. Written by `computeAndStoreGrnAllocation` (`:272`) at post, recomputed by `reallocateGrnCharges` (`:319`). |
| `unit_cost_sen` on the movement / FIFO lot | `inventory_movements` | **Snapshotted at post**: `landedUnitCostMyr` = FX-converted base + per-unit allocated freight (`:434-435`). This is the lot cost the whole downstream margin chain draws on. |
| `qty_accepted` | line | The qty that becomes stock. `qty_received` and `qty_rejected` are record-keeping; only `qty_accepted` produces a movement (`:422`). |
| `invoiced_qty`, `returned_qty` | line | Written by the downstream PI / PR. They are the lock (§6) and they net out of `received_qty` (`:684-704`). |

**The recost cascade.** `recostFromGrn` (`backend/src/scm/lib/recost.ts:211`)
re-derives the authoritative cost for a GRN's received buckets and pushes it down
lots → consumptions → movements → DO → SI. The GR price is only a **fallback**;
the **PI line price is authoritative** (`recost.ts:250-256`), weighted-averaged
across all live PI lines per `grn_item`. DRAFT and CANCELLED PIs are excluded
from that aggregate (`recost.ts:269-272`).

Two read-failure decisions in that file are load-bearing and deliberately not
`?? default`: a failed GRN-rate read aborts rather than defaulting to rate 1
(`recost.ts:242-247` — rate 1 on an RMB GRN capitalises the raw RMB figure as if
it were ringgit), and a failed PI-lines read aborts rather than folding to "no PI"
(`recost.ts:259-266` — that would silently revert every lot to the un-invoiced
estimate).

`recomputeGrnTotals` (`:566`) **fails closed and never throws** (`:570-580`): a
failed read leaves the header unchanged instead of zeroing it.

---

## 8. Desktop and mobile files that must change together

| Concern | Desktop | Mobile |
|---------|---------|--------|
| List columns / filters | `pages/scm-v2/GoodsReceivedListV2.tsx` | `mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` config `:1159` |
| Server pagination opt-in | `useGrnsPaged` | `mobile/MobileModuleList.tsx` `SERVER_PAGINATED` (`:327`) |
| Detail fields | `pages/scm-v2/GoodsReceivedDetailV2.tsx` (read) + `GoodsReceivedDetail.tsx` (edit) | `mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx` config `:324` |
| Post / Cancel actions | `GoodsReceivedDetail.tsx:416-459` | `mobile/MobileModuleDetail.tsx:535-542` |
| PO→GRN conversion + per-line received qty | `pages/scm-v2/GrnFromPo.tsx` | `mobile/MobileConvertWizard.tsx` (`target: "grn"`) — note the surfaces differ **by design**: desktop can pick lines, mobile converts the whole PO (`:60-61`), and mobile posts `asDraft:true` rather than the auto-posting `/from-pos` (`:370-374`) |
| Cache invalidation after a write | the hooks in `vendor/scm/lib/grn-queries.ts` (must include `['inventory']`) | `mobile/sharedInvalidate.ts:72` (`grns` roots + `STOCK_ROOTS`, which includes the SO roots) |

---

## 9. Performance summary

Optimized:
- Detail loads header + items in one `Promise.all` (`:1175-1178`).
- The list's status counts are four `head:true` counts in one `Promise.all`
  (`:911-916`).
- `total_centi` on the list is the stored header value, not a re-sum.
- Desktop list is server-paginated (50/page) with server-side search, sort and
  status counts.

Watch as data grows — the GRN list is the **most expensive of the four sibling
lists**, and structurally so:
- Its enrichment is a real **sequential chain**: `grn_items` (via `paginateAll`,
  so potentially several round trips, `:942-947`) → `grnLineDownstream` (`:961`).
  The second read needs the first read's item ids, so unlike the DO list it cannot
  be collapsed into one parallel wave.
- `grnLineDownstream` fans out over every line id on the page, not every GRN.
- The legacy unpaginated path still `.limit(500)` (`:856`) and is what
  `GrnNew.tsx` reaches through the PO hook.
- Free-text search cannot reach supplier name or PO number (`:886-893`) because
  those are embedded resources.
- `postGrnAndRollup` does a lot inside one request: PO recount, movement write,
  drop-ship reconcile, oversell retro-cost, per-DO restamp + SI restamp, rack
  placement, and a **global** `recomputeSoStockAllocation` (`:522-525`). All are
  best-effort, but they are all in the confirm's request path.

Cross-module context: `docs/perf-optimization-plan.md`. Route/permission
inventory: `docs/generated/`.
