# Houzs ERP Agent Operating Specification

> **Version 1.0 · 17 July 2026.** Owner-provided target operating model for the Houzs Retail & Fulfilment ERP agent ecosystem. Extracted and cleaned from the owner's Word document (`Houzs_ERP_Agent_Operating_Specification.docx`), kept in-repo so every agent PR can cite it. The decision-authority matrices in sections 3-9 are the POLICY SOURCE; per section 11 they must be encoded as machine-readable agent configuration, not copied as prose into a prompt.


## 1. Document purpose and operating principles
This document defines the target operating model and implementation requirements for the Houzs Retail and Fulfilment ERP Agent ecosystem. It covers order fulfilment, delivery, customer communication, replenishment, receivables, commercial intelligence and the relationship with Hookka manufacturing.

### 1.1 Definition of an Agent
In this specification, an Agent is not merely a renamed chatbot. An Agent is an accountable software role comprising an LLM, system instructions, approved tools, data-access scope, workflow state, memory boundaries, decision policy, approval policy, audit trail and measurable service levels.

### 1.2 Core design principles
One visible assistant may route work to multiple specialist Agents; employees should not need to choose the correct Agent manually.
Every write action must be attributable to a named Agent, user, rule version, data snapshot and approval event.
Database access, tool access and approval authority must be enforced by code and permissions, not only by prompt text.
Rules and deterministic calculations remain the source of truth for money, inventory, payroll, taxation, document numbering and accounting postings.
The LLM interprets, plans, explains and coordinates; it does not invent missing operational facts.
The safest useful action is preferred: read, propose, simulate, request approval, execute, verify and record.
Autonomy is granted by transaction class and risk tier, never as a blanket permission to "approve everything".

### 1.3 Three-stage autonomy model
Stage
Operating mode
Agent authority
Human role
Stage 1
Human approval required
Agent reads, analyses, simulates and prepares actions. No material business write is executed without approval.
Review evidence, approve/reject/edit and provide feedback.
Stage 2
Policy-bounded self-approval
Agent may approve and execute low-risk, reversible and policy-compliant actions within explicit thresholds.
Approve exceptions, high-risk transactions and policy changes.
Stage 3
Closed-loop automation
Agent autonomously detects, decides, executes, verifies and recovers within a certified operating envelope.
Govern policy, monitor outcomes, audit samples and handle escalations.

## 2. Target Agent organisation
Users interact with one unified ERP Assistant. The router identifies intent and invokes the appropriate specialist Agent. Specialist Agents communicate through typed hand-offs; they do not exchange unrestricted free-form instructions or share all data by default.

## 9. Highest-level Agent: Group Chief Operating Agent (GCOA)
The Group Chief Operating Agent is the highest operational orchestration layer across Houzs and Hookka. It is not a superuser with unrestricted authority.

Coordinates
Houzs Order Fulfilment Agent, Houzs Delivery Planning & Transport Agent, Houzs Customer Communication Agent, Houzs Retail Purchasing & Replenishment Agent, Houzs Receivables, Collection & Delivery-Release Agent, Houzs Sales & Commercial Intelligence Agent
Primary objective
Optimise end-to-end customer fulfilment, cash conversion, service level, capacity, working capital and risk across both companies.
Authority principle
May orchestrate broadly, but may execute only through specialist tools and their own permission gates.

### 9.1 What the GCOA must do
Translate management goals into measurable operating plans, constraints, owners, milestones and exception thresholds.
Route tasks to specialist Agents and require evidence-backed recommendations in a standard decision packet.
Resolve cross-functional conflicts such as delivery urgency versus payment risk, bulk purchasing versus cash preservation, and production efficiency versus customer priority.
Maintain an enterprise dependency graph from customer order to material, production, finished goods, warehouse, delivery, collection and service outcome.
Run daily and weekly control-tower reviews: overdue orders, shortages, bottlenecks, cash exposure, service failures and decisions awaiting approval.
Detect policy conflicts, stale data, circular Agent delegation, duplicate execution and inconsistent company dimensions.
Track whether approved actions were executed and whether the expected result occurred; open a recovery task when verification fails.
Provide management with alternatives, trade-offs, confidence levels, financial impact, affected customers and reversible versus irreversible consequences.

### 9.2 What the GCOA must not do
It must not bypass specialist Agent permissions, maker-checker controls or company-level segregation of duties.
It must not approve bank payments, payroll changes, refunds, credit notes, inventory write-offs, supplier master changes or accounting period closure merely because it is the highest Agent.
It must not override statutory, tax, employment, safety, data-protection or accounting controls.
It must not silently change business policy, approval thresholds, BOMs, costing methods, customer credit limits or supplier bank details.
It must not combine uncertain data into a confident conclusion without labelling assumptions and requesting verification.

Separate read, propose, create-draft, execute, approve, reverse and administer permissions.
Use maker-checker separation for payments, refunds, supplier bank data, payroll, inventory write-offs and period closing.
Every Agent action must include idempotency keys, transaction boundaries and duplicate-execution protection.
Prompt instructions must never substitute for database constraints, validation, approval workflow or API authorisation.

### 10.2 Data-quality gate
