# Security & Dev-Velocity — Status and Roadmap (2026-07-23)

The single place that says: what was done today, what was deliberately NOT done and
why, and what's next with WHO owns each. Written for a non-technical owner first,
with the technical detail linked. Companion to `SECURITY-AUDIT-2026-07-23.md`,
`THREAT-MODEL.md`, `ACCOUNT-SECURITY-SETUP.md`, and `AI-DEV-VELOCITY.md`.

## The honest one-paragraph summary

A full security audit ran and its fixes shipped: 9 security fixes plus 3 dev-speed/
docs changes, all merged to `main` on 2026-07-23. The known code holes are closed
and defensive protections are live and automatic — nobody has to "use" them. The
database can now be restored to the second (PITR, enabled by the owner). What is
NOT done is everything that only the owner's accounts can change (MFA, R2 file
versioning, branch protection), plus a few things that should not be done without a
safety net (splitting the giant files, a persistent access-audit that needs a live
DB migration). Security is ongoing, not a finish line. This is much safer than the
morning of 2026-07-23 — not "perfect".

## What shipped today (12 PRs, all merged)

Security (audit findings): security headers (#1075), stored-XSS via attachments +
photos (#1076, #1080), cross-company/cross-user access on service cases (#1079),
destructive-script guards + `db:reset` lock (#1081), constant-time secret compare +
SHA-pinned deploy actions (#1084), report-only CSP (#1087), multi-company fail-open
diagnostic (#1089), CORS allow-list (#1090). Dev-speed + docs: route-locator index
(#1106), the velocity plan (#1104), threat model + account-setup guide (#1093).

These are automatic. No one operates them; they protect the system in the
background, and daily ERP use is unchanged.

## Deliberately NOT done (with the reason — not oversights)

- **Splitting the giant files** (`Projects.tsx` 12.8k lines, `mfg-sales-orders.ts`
  10.8k). Real surgery on the live order engine; unsafe to do blind. The
  route-locator (#1106) already captured most of the navigation win. Do it only
  once a staging safety net exists — see Next Steps #2/#4.
- **Persistent access-audit** ("who downloaded which payment slip"). Change-auditing
  already exists (`entity_audit_log`) and request-level access logging exists
  (`requestLog`). A persistent, queryable read-audit needs a new DB migration that
  auto-applies to production — not something to run unsupervised on a database that
  has been wiped before. Design it with the owner.
- **CSP enforce**, **multi-company fail-closed flip**, **seat-height cost strip**
  (`mfg-products`). Each is a follow-up that needs an observation window, a live
  count, or an owner ruling — documented in `BUG-HISTORY.md` and the audit.

## Next steps — ranked, with OWNER

| # | Step | Who | Cost | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | **MFA on Supabase (then GitHub, Cloudflare)** | Owner | free | Highest value. Stops stolen-password logins. Phone, ~3 min. Supabase first. |
| 0 | **R2 object versioning** on `houzs-erp` bucket | Owner (the Cloudflare acct holding the bucket) | ~free | Files have zero recovery today. |
| 0 | **Branch protection on `main`** | Owner (GitHub org admin) | free | Puts a gate before prod deploys. |
| 1 | **Professional penetration test** | Hire a firm | paid | The gold standard for a system with customer + payment data. An AI scan does not replace it. |
| 2 | **Finish the staging safety net** | Owner + AI | small | Staging exists (`houzs-erp-staging`); split its R2 bucket off prod (audit M4) and start testing there before prod. Unlocks safe splitting. |
| 3 | **Persistent access-audit** (sensitive downloads/exports) | AI + owner (migration review) | medium | Design first; needs a prod migration, so do it supervised. |
| 4 | **Split the giant files** | AI, once #2 exists | medium | Do it behind the staging net, one file per PR, tested before prod. |
| 5 | **Restore drill** — actually restore a PITR snapshot into staging | Owner | small | An untested backup is a guess. Prove it works once. |
| 6 | **Install `gbrain`** semantic index in the real working repo | Owner + AI | small | The full RAG index on top of the route-locator. See AI-DEV-VELOCITY.md. |

## The one structural thing that unlocks the rest

Most of the remaining optimisation (splitting files, bigger refactors, the audit
log) is currently unsafe to do because there is **no gate and no test bench**
between a change and the live business: `main` has no branch protection and every
merge auto-deploys to production. Step 2 (staging bench) + branch protection is the
foundation that makes everything after it safe to do. Build that before the rest.

## What "done" means here

Today's work is done and shipped. The list above is not a backlog of failures — it
is the honest map of a security posture that is now good and can keep improving.
Nobody's system is ever "finished"; the goal is to always know where the open doors
are and who is closing the next one.
